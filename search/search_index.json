Furthermore you will need a pencil, eraser, and\nsome paper. To play you also need a few six sided dice (d6).\n\n\nAbilities\n\n\nEach character, NPC or even monster is defined by four abilities.\n\n\nAbilities have ranks going from 1 to 10. Five (5) is the average, conferring\nneither a benefit nor a drawback. Every point below or above five grants an\nadditional benefit. This benefit is called \nability modifier\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbility\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n7\n\n\n8\n\n\n9\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModifier\n\n\n-5\n\n\n-4\n\n\n-3\n\n\n-2\n\n\n-1\n\n\n+0\n\n\n+1\n\n\n+2\n\n\n+3\n\n\n+4\n\n\n+5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf an ability drops to zero, the character dies.\n\n\nMight\n\n\nMight\n (MI) represents the character\ns physical \nstrength\n and\n\nresilience\n. \nEndurance\n and \nhealth\n are derived from\nmight. Your melee weapon damage also derives from might.\n\n\nSpeed\n\n\nSpeed\n (SP) measures the character\ns reflexes and hand-eye coordination. It\nis used for subversive actions (such as sneaking, or lock picking) and is used\nto \nbetter hit\n with melee weapons and ranged weapons.\n\n\nIntelligence\n\n\nIntelligence\n (IN) describes how well your character learns new things, and\nhow well he remembers already existing things. It is a key factor in skills like\nhacking, medicine or engineering.\n\n\nCharisma\n\n\nCharisma\n (CA) represents the character\ns physical attractiveness, force of\npersonality and his ability to lead. It is mostly used in \nsocial\ninteractions\n between characters and NPCs.\n\n\nPools\n\n\nEach creature has two pools: \nEndurance\n and \nhealth\n.\nObjects only have a \nhealth\n pool.\n\n\nEndurance\n\n\nEndurance represents the character\ns short time well being and constitution.\n\n\nEndurance\n is determined by rolling a number of dice equal to your\n\nMight\n \nrank\n and then adding the base \nendurance\n pool\nof your race to the results. Which dice are rolled is also determined by the\nrace.\n\n\nEndurance\n recovers completely once the character has had enough\ntime to rest (usually resting eight hours) without interruptions. Whenever you\npermanently increase or decrease \nMight\n you must roll the\n\nendurance\n dice and add or subtract that value from your\n\nendurance\n pool.\n\n\nA character that reaches zero \nendurance\n is \nincapacitated\n.\n\n\n\n\nHow to determine \nEndurance\n\n\nThis formular uses the \nHuman\n race as an example.\n\n\n\nEndurance\n\n=\n\n15\n\n\n+\n\n\nn\n\n*\n\nd10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\nHealth represents the overall long-term physical health and well being of a\ncharacter. Severe wounds, illness and temporary handicaps (such as broken arms\nor legs) are abstracted away in the health pool.\n\n\nHealth\n is determined by rolling a number of dice equal to your\n\nMight\n \nrank\n and then adding the base \nhealth\n pool of your\nrace to the results. Which dice are rolled is also determined by race.\n\n\nHealth\n cannot recovered by resting, and requires external methods\n(medicine, first aid etc.) to recover. Whenever you permanently increase or\ndecrease \nMight\n you must roll the \nhealth\n dice and add or\nsubtract that value from your \nhealth\n pool.\n\n\nIf \nhealth\n drops to zero, the character is killed.\n\n\n\n\nHow to determine \nHealth\n\n\nThis formular uses the \nHuman\n race as an example.\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n=\n\n5\n\n\n+\n\n\nn\n\n*\n\nd6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkills\n\n\nSkills are areas of expertise a character may acquire throughout the\ncourse of gameplay. Whenever a character attempts a task a skill roll\nis involved.\n\n\nA skill has five ranks: \nuntrained\n, \nproficient\n, \ntrained\n,\n\nexperienced\n, \nmaster\n. The ranks are numbered 1 (untrained) through 5\n(master) respectively. Each rank provides additional bonuses to skill checks and\nallows the selection of additional \nperks\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\nSkill Bonus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntrained\n\n\n-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProficient\n\n\n+0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrained\n\n\n+1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperienced\n\n\n+2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster\n\n\n+4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach skill is associated with an attribute. Ability modifiers are used\nfrom the corresponding associated skill. Every character starts with\nevery skill at the untrained level.\n\n\nIn addition to abilities and skills, skill checks also receive a bonus or\ndrawback from roleplaying. Good roleplay should be rewarded by awarding a bonus\nto the skill check, while bad roleplay or none at all should impose a penalty.\n\n\n\n\nHow to make a \nskill check\n\n\n\nSkill check =\n\n3d6\n\n\u00b1\n\nability\n\n\u00b1\n\nskill\n\n\u00b1\n\nroleplay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoleplaying bonuses\n\n\nYou, as a DM, can allow players to completely ignore a skill check / DC if\nthey are roleplaying very well and/or playing to their characters strengths\nand weaknesses.\n\n\nAlso, a task that\ns trivial or that\ns so easy for a character that she\ndoesn\nt have to roll if the roleplay bonus was 0, can be skipped as well,\neven if no roleplaying is done.\n\n\n\n\nTasks\n\n\nOften characters perform tasks such as repairing, shooting or flying a space\ncraft. It is the game masters job to come up with a difficulty check (\nDC\n).\nThese DCs are recognized by the following categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nDC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVery easy\n\n\n1-8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEasy\n\n\n9-12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModerate\n\n\n13-15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHard\n\n\n16-17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVery Hard\n\n\n18+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a skill check meets or exceeds the set \nDC\n the skill check is\n\nsuccessful\n. If the skill check is less than the \nDC\n the\nskill check is a \nfailure\n.\n\n\n\n\nSucceeding and failing a task\n\n\nSkill check \u2265 Task DC \u21d2 \nsuccess\n\n\nSkill check \n Task DC \u21d2 \nfailure\n\n\n\n\nAiding\n\n\nAt the game master\ns discretion, it is possible for one or more characters to\naid another in an upcoming task (henceforth called the \nmain task\n). The players\naiding must be able to declare, and be able to perform the aid before the main\ntask is attempted (i.e. rolled for). Then they must perform the same skill check\n(consuming an action) within their turn. Every \nsuccess\n of\nthose aiding translates into a tangible benefit for the main task. Such benefits\ncould include (but are not limited to):\n\n\n\n\nBetter outcome of the main task, such as less time or materials used.\n\n\nA lowered difficulty for the main task.\n\n\n\n\nThe actual benefits bestowed upon the main task are up to the game\nmaster. Players should state beforehand what they are trying to\nachieve by helping, for example making sure that the player who\nperforms the main task succeeds more easily, or that the task is done\nfaster. This helps the GM to design any potential benefits.\n\n\nGame masters may also demand that a task is not doable alone, for\nexample moving furniture that is too heavy to be moved by just one\ncharacter, or a high enough wall that requires help from another to\nsuccessfully climb.\n\n\nCompetition\n\n\nWhen two characters, or a character and an NPC, pitch their skills against each\nother both roll the respective skills. Whoever has the highest skill check wins.\nOn a tie the participant on the defensive side wins. If there is no defensive\nparticipant, reroll until a winner is decided.\n\n\nMultiple Successes\n\n\nIf a character has more than one die\nfor a specific skill available, more than one action may be attempted at the\nsame time using that skill. The DM sets the amount of successes required and\nadjusts the DC accordingly. There is still only one DC for all actions, but now\nthe player has roll multiple successes using the available dice.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nMary is a good pilot and thus has 3 dice available and an ability modifier\nof +3. Her ship is under attack, and she wants to deploy counter measures at\nthe right moment, and then make a sharp evasive manoeuver. As she has three\ndice, she may make those two actions at the same time. The GM decides on a\nDC of 6 and Mary rolls: 4 3 6. She expends two ability modifiers to make the\n4 a success and thus succeeds at the task.\n\n\n\n\nPerks \n Flaws\n\n\nPerks\n, and \nflaws\n, are gained through your race and give your\ncharacter special abilities or drawbacks. \nPerks\n and \nflaws\n\naim at making a character more unique. It is up to the game master whether\n\nperks\n or \nflaws\n can be freely purchased.\n\n\nPerks\n\n\nPerks\n add positive modifiers, make a character better or enable\ncertain actions. \nPerks\n have requirements and require Credits to be\nunlocked. A game master may also give them out based on experience throughout\ngame play, or based on a character\ns background story.\n\n\nFlaws\n\n\nFlaws\n reduce values, make a character weaker or disable certain\nactions. Usually \nflaws\n can\nt be taken freely while playing.\n\nFlaws\n should be chosen during character creation with the GMs help, or\nassigned to by the character while playing. Also, each \nflaw\n awards a\nbenefit in return, but can also give Credits to the character instead.\n\n\nImproving your character\n\n\nCharacters are not improved by experience but by spending time and money.\nMoney can buy time at the gym, implants and most importantly training\nlessons for skills.\n\n\nDowngrading abilities may only be done at the GMs discretion, or as a temporary\nor permanent effect from adventuring (such as scars, wounds, etc.).\n\n\nImproving an ability costs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Rank\n\n\nCost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n-512 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n-162 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n-32 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n-2 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n2 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n32 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n162 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n512 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n1 250 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula: \ncost = abs(mod) ^ 4 * 2000\n\n\nImproving a skill costs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Rank\n\n\nRank level\n\n\nCost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntrained\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProficient\n\n\n1\n\n\n1 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrained\n\n\n2\n\n\n4 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperienced\n\n\n3\n\n\n25 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster\n\n\n4\n\n\n82 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula: \ncost = ((x - 1) ^ 3) * 3000 + 1000\n\n\nBuying \nperks\n may be done at any time, and the \nperks\n\ndescription lists the price.\n\n\nCombat\n\n\nDefence\n\n\nAny attack roll has to be equal to or exceed a creatures defence value. The\ndefence value of a creature is described by its speed and cover. If the target\nis attacked in melee combat, the defence value equals the targets melee skill\ncheck result.\n\n\n\n\nHow to determine \nDefence\n\n\n\nDefence = \n10\n\n+\n\nSpeed\n\n+\n\nCover\n\n\n\nor\n\n\nDefence (melee) = \n3d6 + skill modifiers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCover\n\n\nCover provides vital bonuses to the creature\ns defence. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCover\n\n\nBonus\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight Cover\n\n\n+2\n\n\n-2 \nendurance damage\nAllows Stealth\n\n\nFoliage, Smoke, Low Light\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeavy Cover\n\n\n+4\n\n\n-4 \nendurance damage\n\n\nComplete darkness, Chest high inpenetrable wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntrenched\n\n\n+6\n\n\n-6 \nendurance damage\nimmunity to \ncritical hits\n\n\nCombined through Low and Heavy Cover, behind solid metal doors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmunity to \ncritical hits\n\n\nThe immunity does not apply for weapons that bypass cover, such as grenades\nthrown right into the cover. The bonus from cover still applies to defence\nhowever.\n\n\nThe DM may decide that the bonus to cover does not apply.\n\n\n\n\nAttack \n\n\nAny attack roll is done using a weapon and its related skill. Attacks beyond a\nweapons effective range impose penalties to the attack roll.\n\n\nSome weapons allow multiple shots to be fired, denoted by the\n\nRoF\n value of a weapon. If a weapons\n\nRoF\n value is higher than one, additional shots \nmay\n\nbe fired to increase the hit chance and \ncritical hit\n chance.\n\n\n\n\nRoF Example\n\n\nIf a weapon has a \nRoF\n value of 2, you may fire an\nextra bullet and add \n1d6\n to your attack, resulting in \n4d6\n total.\n\n\n\n\nIf the \nattack\n is equal to or higher than the targets \ndefence\n\nattack is \nsuccessful\n.\n\n\nIf the \nattack\n is less than the targets \ndefence\n value the attack\n\nfails\n.\n\n\nOn a hit you can deal \ndamage\n and potential \ncritical\ndamage\n.\n\n\n\n\nHow to roll an \nAttack\n\n\n\nAttack = \n3d6\n\n+\n\nweapon\n\n+\n\nskill\n\n+\n\n1d6\n\n-\n\nrange penalty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDamage \n\n\nDamage is dealt by environment, traps or simply by successful attacks from\ncreatures and characters.\n\n\nArmour provides \nDR\n (damage reduction). If a\ntarget\ns \nDR\n is higher than the inflicted damage,\nthey don\nt take any damage at all (except for \ncritical\ndamage\n).\n\n\nNormal damage always targets \nendurance\n first, called \nendurance\ndamage\n. If \nendurance\n is zero, all exceeding and\nsubsequent damage is dealt to \nhealth\n instead, called \nhealth\ndamage\n.\n\n\nDamaging objects is the same as damaging another player or NPC, except that\ninanimate objects have no \nendurance\n, just \nhealth\n.\n\n\n\n\nDamaged characters\n\n\nIf \nendurance\n drops to zero the character\nbecomes \nincapacitated\n.\n If \nhealth\n drops to zero the\ncharacter is \ndead\n.\n\n\n\n\nCritical Hit\n\n\nWhenever you roll for an attack and \nhit\n, every \n6\n you rolled with a\n\nd6\n, including extra dice from \nRoF\n, causes\nadditional \ncritical damage\n.\n\n\nCritical Damage \n\n\nCritical damage\n inflicts additional damage to the health\npool, even if the targets \nendurance\n isn\nt at 0 yet.\n\n\nCritical damage\n is also reduced by the target\ns\n\nDR\n, but cannot be less than 1. Every critical\nhit deals at least 1 damage, disregarding any armour the target may have.\n\n\nEach weapon specifies its own \ncritical damage\n.\n\n\nStatus\n\n\nIncapacitated\n\n\nA creature becomes incapacitated once its\n\nendurance\n drops to zero. An incapacitated\ncreature needs some time (at least a few minutes, up to hours) to become\nconcious again.\n\n\nMost of the time an incapacitated creature needs medical attention to regain\nconciousness.\n\n\nDead\n\n\nA creature is dead if its \nhealth\n drops to zero.\n\n\nCrisis\n\n\nWhenever time and order of action is of critical concern a \ncrisis\n starts.\nCombat is always a crisis, but other dangerous situation are also considered\na crisis, such as escaping a space ship that is about to explode. What\nconstitutes a crisis is always up the game master.\n\n\nTurn order \n\n\nWhen a crisis starts, all involved have to determine their turn order. Roll a 6\nsided die (d6) and add your \nSpeed\n and\n\nIntelligence\n modifiers to the result.\n\nPerks\n and \nflaws\n may give additional bonuses or penalties to\n\ninitiative\n. Players, NPCs and monsters start in\nthe order of the highest \ninitiative\n to lowest.\nIn case of a tie the person with the highest die result wins. If there is still\na tie roll again.\n\n\n\n\nHow to determine \nturn order\n\n\n\n\nTurn Order\n\n=\n\n1d6\n\n\u00b1\n\n\n  \nSpeed\n\n\n\n\u00b1\n\n\n  \nIntelligence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActions\n\n\nOnce it is a player\ns turn in a crisis, he or she may do \ntwo actions\n. An\naction takes a small amount of time, and may involve a skill check. The game\nmaster may decide that a task takes more than one action, or even takes a couple\nof rounds. Any number of actions may be converted to \nready actions\n. These\nare specific conditions set by the player that trigger when an external event\noccurs. If the condition does not occur before his or her next turn, the \nready\naction\n is lost.\n\n\nEverything you do in a crisis as part of an action is almost all of the time\nsolvable through a skill check. Movement in combat is done through\n\nAthletics\n, hitting an enemy with a sword through \nMelee\n or getting a\nblast door open uses \nHacking\n.\n\n\nFree Actions\n\n\nA game master may also decide that something takes so little time,\nthat it does not count towards the player\ns amount of actions in that\nround. These actions are called \nfree actions\n. For example, the\ngame master may decide that letting go of a ledge takes no time and is\nthus a \nfree action\n.\n\n\nReactions\n\n\nReactions are skill checks that a player or NPC must make upon the\nrequest of the game master. Reactions are triggered by external\nevents, and may happen out of turn for the player. The game master\nsets a DC and a skill, which the player has to succeed or face certain\nconsequences. These reactions do not detract from the player or NPCs\navailable actions on his turn.\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nTwo players climb a mountain side. One player fails his athletics check,\nslips and falls. The other player may receive a reaction to catch him.\nShould he fail his friend falls, and if he succeeds he may help is friend to\ngain footing again.\n\n\n\n\nMaking a character\n\n\nFirst: Choose a race\n\n\nQ* supports multiple races, but your game master may restrict them as necessary.\nRaces define basic attributes, and may grant you perks from the get go. All\nraces are balanced, with some having slight benefits which are weighed out by\ndrawbacks in other areas.\n\n\nSelect a race, and note their starting abilities, perks and flaws on your sheet\nof paper.\n\n\nHuman\n\n\nHumans are the versatile race of Q*, with having no obvious benefits or\ndrawbacks. They are suitable for all kinds of game play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMight\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeed\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntelligence\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharisma\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase Endurance\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase Health\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndurance\n\n\nd10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\nd6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerks\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlaws\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond: Make adaptions\n\n\nThe game master hands out starting money to all players. Use these funds to\npurchase increases in abilities, skills or even \nperks\n. If your game\nmaster allows it, you can take \nflaws\n and decrease abilities to\nincrease your starting fund. If you decrease an ability you gain as much money\nas it would have cost you to increase that ability to the old value.\n\n\nYou should increase relevant attributes, and buy ranks in the skills that best\nsuit your character.\n\n\nThird: Roll Endurance and Health\n\n\nUse your race\ns \nendurance\n and \nhealth\n die, and your new\n\nMight\n \nrank\n to roll \nendurance\n and \nhealth\n.\nNote these values on your character sheet.\n\n\nFourth: Buy equipment\n\n\nLast but not least buy equipment that suits your character. See\n\nequipment\n.\n\n\nAvailable Skills\n\n\nThe following skills are available in the base system of Q*:\n\n\nMight Skills\n\n\nAthletics\n\n\nis used to perform actions such as jumping, climbing, tumbling, lifting,\ndragging or rope walking. Extra ability modifiers may be spent on completing a\ntask faster, or to avoid extra falling damage in case of controlled jumps.\nAthletics is also used to move out of harms way. It can be used to dodge hazards\nsuch as a falling debris.\n\n\nMelee\n\n\nis the skill involved with all sorts of melee weapons, such as blades, axes,\nclubs or bare fists and kicks. Extra ability modifiers can be used to purchase\nextra damage (1 modifier per point) or extra critical damage (1 modifier per two\npoints). It\ns also used for defending against a melee attack, either by\ndeflecting, blocking or dodging an attack.\n\n\nMicro Gravity\n\n\nis the skill that replaces \nAthletics\n in micro gravity environments. It is\nused to manoeuvre in such weightless conditions.\n\n\nSpeed Skills\n\n\nDriving\n\n\nallows someone to steer land or sea based vehicles, such as cars, motorcycles\nand tanks.\n\n\nHeavy Weapons\n\n\nallows operations of heavy or stationary guns. Such guns are usually mounted\nturrets on ships and tanks, but can also be land based artillery or very large\nman portable weapons such as rocket launchers or guided missile platforms.\nExtra ability modifiers can be spend on either extra normal (1 modifier per\npoint) or critical damage (1 modifier per two points).\n\n\nLight Weapons\n\n\nis used to operate firearms such as pistols, rifles, or shotguns. Light weapons\nalso applies to man portable weapons such as grenade launchers or light machine\nguns. Extra ability modifiers can be spent on extra damage. Extra ability\nmodifiers can be spend on either extra normal (1 modifier per point) or critical\ndamage (1 modifier per two points).\n\n\nPiloting\n\n\nis used to pilot any air or space borne vehicle. It\ns also used in vessel combat\nto attack and defend.\n\n\nStealth\n\n\nis used to sneak about, hide, hide things or use sleight of hand to conceal\nitems. Its counter skill is \nNotice\n.\n\n\nIntelligence Skills\n\n\nEngineering\n\n\nis used to construct and repair devices, buildings and vehicles. Servicing a\nmotorcycle is considered engineering, as is constructing fortifications or\nrepairing an airlock. Extra ability modifiers can be used to use less materials\nor complete the action faster.\n\n\nExplosives\n\n\ncan be used to disarm, handle or even build explosive ordinance. When explosives\nare thrown (i.e. grenades) roll Athletics instead. Otherwise defusing and\nplanting explosives is a competition between the one setting it, and the one\ndefusing it.\n\n\nFirst Aid\n\n\nis used to treat wounds and cure health damage with the help of a medical item.\nA first aid check requires a first aid kit (or similar) and doubles the amount\nof dice rolled for \nhealth\n and \nendurance\n if the check is\n\nsuccessful\n. If the check \nfails\n the\nnormal amount of dice are applied as healing. The game master may also limit how\noften first aid can actually benefit a character depending on the severity of\nthe wounds. See \nmedical items\n for examples.\n\n\nHacking\n\n\nis used to bypass electronic security. Its counter skill is also hacking. Extra\nability modifiers can be used to get the job done faster.\n\n\nKnowledge\n\n\nis chosen for a particular area, e.g. history, religion, etc. For all other\nknowledge skills, the character only has basic, common knowledge.\n\n\nNotice\n\n\nis used to spot hidden things or notice small details that would otherwise be\nmissed. It is the counter part skill to \nStealth\n.\n\n\nScience\n\n\nis chosen for a particular scientific field, e.g. geology, biology, astronomy,\nmedicine, etc. For all other scientific areas that weren\nt chosen, the character\nhas basic knowledge. They only know common knowledge in these areas (according\nto their education), but nothing special.\n\n\nCharisma Skills\n\n\nOratory\n\n\nis used to sway another in ones favour through social interactions. It allows a\ncharacter to bargain, bluff, intimidate or charm another. The counter skill is\ncalled \nSense Motive\n.\n\n\nSense Motive\n\n\nallows to spot bluffs in conversations, resist an intimidation attempt, notice\nlies etc. It is the counter part skill to \nOratory\n.",

            "text": "Task DCs\n\n\nThis document should be a guide for the dungeon master on how to design\nDCs for tasks. This of course is only a guideline, and the game masters\nmay set the DCs at their discretion. Just be fair, as most players won\nt\ntolerate unfairness for long.\n\n\nDesigning DCs\n\n\nThe easiest way to go about designing DCs is to have a baseline on what\nan average difficult task in said skill would be (so a DC 5) and compare\nfrom there. After you have determined the base DC, you then add or subtract\nexternal influences.\n\n\nSkills\n\n\nAthletics\n\n\nAthletics is a difficult topic. Generally jumping three metres is\nsomething every able bodied human should be capable of doing with a\nrunning head start (DC 3). Adverse conditions (for example wet\nsurfaces, or the need jump over a ledge) should add to the DC of said\njump. Additional metres, or the inability to make a running head start\nshould also increase the DC. Decrease the DC if the target ledge of\nthe jump is below the start ledge, or if there\ns someone on the other\nside to catch the jumper.\n\n\nClimbing relies heavily on external factors, such as the surface,\nweather, and whether climbing gear is available. Long climbs might\nrequire multiple checks, where partial failures might bar a player\nfrom ascending any further. Climbing also heavily benefits from one\nexperienced climber that goes ahead and instructs others.\n\n\nThrowing depends on the weight. For example a 0.3 kg grenade can\nbe thrown 40 metres by the average person while standing still. A\n1 kg object roughly 30 metres. Ranges may increase with a half or\nfull approach.\n\n\nDriving\n\n\nSomeone who has at least some experience in driving should not have to\nroll to drive from point A to point B in normal street conditions.\nDriving skill checks should be made at specific points when required.\nChasing another vehicle, trying to shake a chasing vehicle or driving\nrecklessly in traffic are all conditions were a driving check might be\ncalled for. Difficult off-road driving, driving while being shot at or\noperating unfamiliar vehicles might also call for driving checks.\n\n\nEngineering\n\n\nPlanning an engineering project might always be a low or average DC\nbut might take more time. Generally speaking the more planning goes\ninto an engineering project, the lower the DC should be. Available to\na wide variety of tools (-1), or building materials (-1) should\nprovide bonuses, while the absence of these should make the task\nharder. It depends highly on the project itself, but the material\nshould change the attributes of the final product instead of making\nthe DC harder. While building a house out of wood is equally as\nchallenging as building one out of brick, the wooden house has\ndifferent properties. Reflect these changes in the final product\ninstead of adding to the DC. Of course there are also wrong materials\nfor certain products, for example you would not fix a hull breach of a\nspace ship with wood.\n\n\nHacking\n\n\nHacking, contrary to popular belief, requires a lot of preparation. Usually\nsystems to be hacked are analysed first and might require several hours if\nnot weeks to find a weakness. Systems that have already been broken, and\nhave an exploit written for them, are easier to be hacked and sometimes do\nnot require any expertise at all. Such DCs can be low, and the difficulty\ncould be counter acted by cost. Buying exploits, or even zero day exploits\nis expensive. Finding your own exploits can be a difficult or time consuming\ntask.\n\n\nHeavy Weapons\n\n\nJust like most light weapons (see below) heavy weapons have an effective\nrange that indicate a range and hit probability. But unlike with light\nweapons the weapon specifies what size of target its effective range is\nrated for.\n\n\nLight Weapons\n\n\nAll light weapons (pistols, rifles etc.) have an effective range. This\nrange indicates how many metres away a decently skilled shooter is able\nto hit a man sized target half the time (DC 5). There is also an upper\nlimit in certain areas, as it becomes increasingly difficult to see\nand shoot enemies further away than 400 metres without a scope. Being\nin a firing prone position helps (-1), as does having time to aim with\na supported weapon (-1). Being otherwise prone doesn\nt help (+1), neither\ndoes firing a weapon beyond its effective range (+1). Weather is a huge\nfactor especially at longer ranges.

The environment can impose penalties to a vessel, or simply disable, damage,\nor destroy it.\n\n\nSpace means that the vessel is capable of manoeuvring in outer space, air means\nthat is also capable of flying through an atmosphere. If a vessel has both space\nand air listed, the vessel is capable of making a transition from atmosphere to\nouter space and vice versa. Land means that the vessel moves on land, and water\nmeans that it moves on or in water.\n\n\nVessel Statistics\n\n\nAttack\n\n\nAny vessel is outfitted with electronics for aim assistance, manoeuvring and so\nforth. Bigger and better vessels have better and more sophisticated electronics\nthan smaller and cheaper vessels. The attack value is a bonus the pilot of a\nsmall vessel or officer of a bigger vessel gains when attacking.\n\n\nDefence\n\n\nShips also have an armour rating. Armour reduces the incoming damage (both\nnormal and critical) by the listed damage reduction amount. Any damage above the\ndamage reduction is passed on to the ships shield hit points or hull integrity.\nThe full damage is subtracted from the hit points of the armour. If the armour\nreaches zero hit points its damage reduction drops to zero and thus stops being\nuseful.\n\n\nA vessel can outfit multiple armour plating. The damage reduction is not\ncumulative, but the armour hit points are, given the armour is of the same type.\nDamage is always subtracted from the armour providing the most damage reduction\nfirst.\n\n\nSpeed\n\n\nSmaller vessels have the upper hand when it comes to manoeuvring. As such, they\ngain a bonus to evading enemy fire, while bigger, slower vessels are penalised.\n\n\nShield Hit Points\n\n\nShields come in great variety to protect a vessel versus any kind of damage.\nF.e. a shield might be a simple sand screen that deflects beam and laser\nweapons. Also, point-defence versus small fighter wings, boarding pods, or\nmissiles add to the shield hit points value. The hit points abstract the\nrecharge speed of shields, or reload speed of point defence.\n\n\nHull Integrity\n\n\nHull Integrity is the Health for vessels, and depends on the size and quality of\nthe vessel. When dropping below the maximum, the vessel begins venting\natmosphere or becomes otherwise impeded, which might be dangerous by itself. If\nthe hull integrity drops below one half of the maximum, the vessel\ns power\nsupply is cut, disabling all functions. If the hull integrity reaches zero, the\nvessel is utterly destroyed in a blast. Certain weapons are designed to drop the\nhull integrity temporarily, so that the vessel can be boarded rather than\ndestroyed. See vessel equipment for details.\n\n\nSize\n\n\nEvery vessel is categorised into small, medium, large, or capital vessels. The\nvessel statistics also provide a single value for its size. The size defines how\nmuch space there is on a vessel for cargo, rooms such as quarters, or even\nspecialised modules like docking bays.\n\n\nVessel Combat\n\n\nAttacking and Defending\n\n\nAttacking and defending follow the competition rules of Q*. The pilot of a\nvessel can make an attack roll using their dice pool of the associated skill.\nBesides any ability modifiers, the attacker also gains or loses the vessels\nattack value. The same rules apply to the defender.\n\n\nExample: An attacker is trained with piloting the vessel, and thus has 3 dice\nfor the check. The character also has a +2 modifier on the associated ability,\nand the vessel has +1 on its attack value, resulting in +3, that can be spent\nacross any of the 3 dice. The defender also rolls on the associated piloting\nskill in which they are trained, has a +1 modifier on the associated ability,\nbut a -1 speed value due to the vessel size. Both attacker and defender can\napply positive modifiers or have to subtract negative ones. The one with the\nhigher result succeeds.\n\n\nSmart Weapons\n\n\nWeapons with guided weapon systems such as missiles or torpedos do not depend on\nthe pilots skills. The statistics for these weapon provide their own \nskill\nrank\n and \nattack value\n. If the vessel has multiple launchers for these\nweapons, follow the \nmultiple weapons\n rules.\n\n\nMultiple Weapons\n\n\nWeapons of the same type can be fired in groups to a maximum of 5. There are two\nkinds of bonuses for having more than 1 weapon, which the attacker can choose\nwhen firing.\n\n\nSpread Fire Mode\n\n\nEvery additional weapon reduces the defender\ns \nspeed value\n by one, until it\nreaches 0. The \nspeed value\n due to multiple weapons can\nt fall below 0.\n\n\nExample: An attacker is firing a battery of 4 rail guns upon a small vessel with\na \nspeed value\n of +2. The attacker has 4 dice and +4 on his attack due to the\npilot\ns skill. Because the attacker has 4 rail guns, they could reduce any\ndefender\ns \nspeed value\n by 3, to a minimum of 0. In this case the defender\ns\n\nspeed value\n is reduced to 0. The attack succeeds, and deals damage.\n\n\nFocused Fire Mode\n\n\nEvery die that exceeds the defender\ns highest roll results in another hit.\n\n\nExample: An attacker is firing a battery of 4 rail guns upon a small vessel with\na \nspeed value\n of +2. The attacker has 4 dice and +4 on his attack due to the\npilots skill. The attacker decides to add additional damage rather than reducing\nthe enemy\ns speed value. Two of his dice, after applying bonuses, exceed the\ndefender\ns defence roll. Instead of dealing damage once, the attacker deals\ndamage twice.\n\n\nDamaging\n\n\nIf the attack succeeds, the attacker can deal damage to the attacked vessel. The\ndamage is reduced by the attacked vessels damage reduction. Any exceeding damage\nis subtracted from the ships shield hit points or hull integrity.\n\n\nExample: The attacking ship fires a missile that would deal 20 points of damage\nto the attacked vessel. The attacked vessel has four armour plates with 10\ndamage reduction and 50 hit points, resulting in a total of 10 damage reduction\nand 200 hit points. The damage of the missile is reduced by 10 by the armours\ndamage reduction, reducing the armour hit points by 20 to a total of 180, and\nthe ships shield hit points or hull integrity by 10.\n\n\nBoarding\n\n\nBoarding only becomes an option once the shield hit points of a vessel are\nreduced to 0.\n\n\nOptional\n\n\nFuel\n\n\nPower",

            "text": "After the second Chernobyl disaster, the Zone was littered with spots\nwhere the laws of nature and physics had been corrupted. These small\noddities are called anomalies. They are hazardous, often deadly,\ntowards human beings and other creatures as they can deliver electric\nshocks or burn, corrode and distort physical objects. Most anomalies\nproduce visible air or light distortions, so their extent can be\ndetermined by throwing anything that is made of metal, like bolts, to\ntrigger them. The anomalies seem to emit a powerful magnetic field, so\nit is logical to assume that the anomalies are triggered by anything\nmade of metal that enters the magnetic field. Because vertebrate life\non earth has iron-based blood, those creatures with enough body mass\nare capable of triggering the anomalies.\n\n\nSpringboard\n\n\nIt was one of the first types of anomalies ever recorded. A\nSpringboard is an unstable gravitational field limited to a pocket on\nground level, about 1-2 meters wide. Reacts to the presence of\ncreatures or objects by sending out a powerful shock wave that damages\nanything within radius. The damage caused by this changes throughout\nthe anomaly\ns lifetime, ranging from minor bruises through serious\nwounds to instant death.\n\n\nA Springboard anomaly has an activation radius of roughly 2 to 4\nmetres. Once triggered it sends out a shock wave that does \n4d6\npoints of critical damage\n to anyone within its radius.\n\n\nKnown to produce the following artifacts:\n\nJellyfish\n,\n\nNightstar\n,\n\nStone Flower\n.\n\n\nWhirligig\n\n\nA common and dangerous anomaly, which snatches its victims up in the\nair and spins them at a breakneck speed. The exact nature of the\nWhirligig remains unknown. The anomaly can be recognized by a light\nwhirlwind of dust above and by body fragments scattered in the\nvicinity. Victims caught on its outer rim, far enough from the maximum\neffect zone at the center, can escape the Whirligig with relatively\nminor injuries.\n\n\nThe whirligig is a weaker form of the \nVortex\n anomaly. It is\noften found off the ground and pulls unsuspecting victims into the air\ntowards its centre. The whirligig has an activation radius of roughly\n8 to 10 metres. It is possible to escape the anti-gravitational pull\nof a Whirligig by holding onto something solid on the ground, or by\nbeing helped by someone outside its pull. Anyone within \n15 metres of\nthe explosion takes 2d6 points of critical damage\n, everyone \nwithin\n5 metres takes 4d6 points of critical damage\n, and everyone within 1\nmetre of the explosion (including directly at the centre) is killed\ninstantly.\n\n\nKnown to produce the following artifacts:\n\nStone Blood\n,\n\nMeat Chunk\n,\n\nWrenched\n,\n\nSoul\n.\n\n\nVortex\n\n\nAn anomaly of presumably gravitational nature. When triggered, the\ntremendous power of the Vortex drags everything within the radius\n10-15 meters towards the center. Victims drawn into the core have\nlittle to no chance of survival: their bodies are quickly constricted\ninto a tight lump, only to be blown up in a powerful discharge of\nenergy a moment later.  In some cases, they may levitate in air with\nagony, and soon their entire systems are shredded into mere skeletal\nand flesh parts.\n\n\nOnce triggered this anomaly drags everything within a radius of 15\nmetres into its centre. After a short amount of the time the vortex\nanomaly explodes killing anything that has been dragged into its\ncentre. It is only possible to escape the pull by holding onto something\nsolid. The vortex will explode after a set amount of time, regardless\nof whether something was pulled into its centre or not. Anyone within\n\n15 metres of the explosion takes 4d6 points of critical damage\n,\neveryone \nwithin 5 metres takes 8d6 points of critical damage\n, and\neveryone within 1 metre of the explosion (including directly at the\ncentre) is killed instantly.\n\n\nKnown to produce the following artifacts:\n\nNightstar\n,\n\nGravi\n,\n\nGoldfish\n.\n\n\nBurner\n\n\nThe Burner can be a bit difficult to see, even in daylight, as it\ns\nonly revealed by a faint heat haze. If the anomaly is triggered by\neither a living being or an object such as a metal bolt, it shoots out\na tall pillar of flame in the air, burning everything in its\nvicinity. Though somewhat rare, the Burner anomaly is often found in\nclusters.\n\n\nOnce a Burner is triggered it shoots out a directed flame of roughly\nfour metres in length. Anything within its path takes \n4 points of\nfire damage per second\n. Experienced stalkers are capable of dodging\nthe directed flaming jet of a Burner.\n\n\nKnown to produce the following artifacts:\n\nCrystal\n,\n\nFireball\n.\n\n\nComet\n\n\nThe Comet anomaly functions much like a Burner anomaly in that it\ndeals fire damage on close contact, but with a key difference in that\nthe Comet is mobile, hovering around within a certain area at a rapid\npace.\n\n\nA Comet anomaly is always moving, either in a circle, or following along\na straight path. It will not stop after having hit something (or someone)\nand will always follow its path. Being hit by a comet deals \n2d6 points of\nimpact damage, and 2d6 points of fire damage\n.\n\n\nFruit Punch\n\n\nThe Fruit Punch is a puddle of lambent green liquid that is easily\nvisible in almost any environment due to its bright glow and\ndistinctive hissing and bubbling noises. On contact with creatures or\nobjects such as bolts, a Fruit Punch lights up brightly and emits a\nsharp hissing sound. It is extremely corrosive, damaging creatures and\nobjects on contact.\n\n\nA Fruit Punch as an activation radius between \none and two metres\n.\nOnce activated it deals \n3d6 points of acid damage\n to anyone caught\nwithin it. Any matter left within the Fruit Punch anomaly is usually\ndissolved within a few hours.\n\n\nKnown to produce the following artifacts:\n\nStone Blood\n,\n\nMeat Chunk\n,\n\nKolobok\n,\n\nFirefly\n (rarely),\n\nBubble\n (rarely).\n\n\nElectro\n\n\nAn anomalous formation, roughly 10 meters in diameter, accumulating\nlarge quantities of static electricity. When triggered, the anomaly\nbursts into a storm of arcing electricity nearly always lethal to all\nliving beings. Easily recognizable by the blue gas it emits, along\nwith the endless arcing of small bolts of electricity in the\nvicinity.\n\n\nOnce triggered the anomaly does \n10d6 points electricity damage\n,\nwhich is equally distributed among all those within it\ns path.\n\n\nKnown to produce the following artifacts:\n\nSparkler\n,\n\nFlash\n,\n\nMoonlight\n,\n\nBattery\n,\n\nShell\n.\n\nSnowflake\n.\n\n\nBurnt Fuzz\n\n\nThis anomaly is usually found outdoors. It resembles moss or vines,\nhanging down like curtains from its growing spot. Reacts to rapidly\napproaching living beings by discharging a cloud of projectiles\nseverely injuring uncovered or lightly protected skin upon\ncontact. Does not react to slowly moving targets. Burnt Fuzz is\ngenerally considered the least dangerous anomaly in the Zone since it\ncan be easily spotted and avoided.\n\n\nBurnt Fuzz deals \n1d6 points of damage\n to rapidly moving targets.\nIt can be easily avoided by slowly moving past it. Burnt Fuzz is the\nonly anomaly that doesn\nt react to bolts. It does not create any\nartifacts.\n\n\nRadiation\n\n\nPockets of ionizing radiation, or simply radiation for short (areas\nwhere the ambient radiation count exceeds 50 mR per hour) can be found\nall over the Zone. In the outside areas, radiation tends to be\ndominant in wide, open spaces and on piles of scrap (such as the dirt\nor scrap piles in Garbage. Also cars, tractors and anything\nmechanical). Radiation in itself doesn\nt form artifacts.\n\n\nAreas affected by radiation vary greatly in size, shape, and in their\nstrength. But each give out noticeable RAD per minute or hour.\n\n\nSpace Anomaly\n\n\nIt is truly the ultimate result of the Zone\ns instability as now it\nalters the very fabric of reality and distorts time and space,\nseemingly creating miniature Wormholes, which \nteleport\n the player\nand anything thrown into it to another spot.\n\n\nSpace Anomalies may either teleport anything thrown into them somewhere\nelse.\n\n\nSpace Bubble\n\n\nAttention. We are stuck in an anomaly....can\nt get out......it\ns\nlike space is warped......which ever way we go\ncan\nt\nmove\nequipment has gone off the rails....can see the outline of a\ntown on the horizon\nour coordinates\n51\n10..3..1..2....Is anybody\nout there\n?\n \n Unfortunate stalker trapped in a space bubble.\n\n\nNot much is known about this kind of anomaly, except that anything that\nventures into them is never to be seen again.\n\n\nThe Space Bubble is a special variant of the \nSpace Anomaly\n,\nin that it creates a discrete separate region of space-time, trapping all\nwho enter it. Navigating a Space Bubble is almost impossible, without the\nhelp of a \nCompass\n artifact.\n\n\nKnown to produce the following artifacts: \nCompass\n.\n\n\nEmission\n\n\nAn emission or blowout is a sudden and powerful release of excess\nenergy from the centre of the Zone. During a blowout, the energy\nfloats from the center of the Zone to the outskirts in a circular\npattern, affecting the minds and bodies of the living. Emissions are\nprecluded by a stormy cloud front, lightning, thunder and the sky\nturning red.\n\n\nAnyone trapped outside when an emission hits is killed instantly or\nturned into a zombie.
