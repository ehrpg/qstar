A GM also requires these dice. A d20 or d100 also can be useful when rolling on random tables. Basic Mechanics \u00b6 Dice \u00b6 Every character uses a d4 , d6 , d8 , d10 and a d12 for everything he\u2019s doing. The higher the die, the better the chance on rolling higher , which is better . Fractions \u00b6 All fractions are always rounded down. When a Skill is divided, divide the number of sides of the die. Flat modifiers are added to the sides of the die. Skill Fraction d12 / 2 = 6 Skill Fraction ( d12 + 3 ) / 2 = 7 Negative Values \u00b6 Some values cannot be negative, e.g. Resources . If such a value were to drop to below 0, it either prohibits certain actions, it has consequences or it\u2019s simply ignored and the value set to 0. Circumstance \u00b6 Most of the formulas and values can be influenced by circumstance, such as racial traits, talents, equipment, environmental factors such as bad or particularly good visibility, wind, etc. Die Rolls \u00b6 There are three different kind of die rolls: Task rolls, which include Attribute and Skill rolls including Attacks, Damage rolls, and Random rolls. All creatures are defined by Attributes and Skills, which are used for all Task rolls and some Damage rolls. Every roll uses a set amount of dice. Task rolls use the corresponding Attribute\u2019s or Skill\u2019s die. Damage rolls use the weapon\u2019s corresponding dice. Random rolls use the random table\u2019s corresponding dice. Task and Damage rolls can receive bonuses and penalties from the creature\u2019s Talents, Race, role-playing, etc. Task Difficulty \u00b6 A task\u2019s Difficulty Level is always 4. The only exceptions are passive values in combat, e.g. a character\u2019s Parry value. A check has to be equal to or higher this Difficulty Level in order to succeed. Otherwise, the check fails. Circumstances modify the check positively or negatively. Check Failures A failed check doesn\u2019t necessarily mean, that the check completely failed. E.g. when climbing, a failed check might simply mean, that there was no progress while climbing. Or a failed sailing check might mean, that the voyage takes a few days longer. Critical Failures \u00b6 If the die for a Task roll comes up with a 1, roll again. If it\u2019s another 1, the task critically fails. A critical fail causes other penalties in addition to failing the check, such as loss of resources, items, reputation etc. Critical Successes \u00b6 Whenever a die is rolled with its highest possible result (e.g. rolling a 10 on a d10 ), the die explodes . This allows you to roll the die again, and add the result to your check. A die can explode multiple times. Contests \u00b6 When two parties compete with each other in the same Skill or even different Skills and stats, both parties have to roll. The party with the higher result wins the contest. On a tie both parties roll again. Getting Started \u00b6 Get started by reading the Character Creation section. Glossary \u00b6 Action point AP, used for atomic actions in a crisis. Base Value A base value that\u2019s used for rolls or to determine values. It\u2019s the same for all characters and creatures.

In a crisis time slows down and actions become more atomic. Difficulty \u00b6 Every task has a difficulty of 4. Some tasks require equipment or knowledge, in order to not suffer a penalty. Other tasks are very easy, and the roll gains a bonus, or you don\u2019t have to roll at all. Not all tasks require a check. For example, finding some information inside books can be done without a skill check given enough time. A good skill check could reduce the time spent searching, or it could unearth additional information that might be helpful. Difficulty This is only a guideline about tasks and the modifiers they impose. Modifier Name Description -4 Trivial Everyday tasks. -3 Mundane Everyday tasks, which can be done by almost everyone. -2 Routine Tasks you do every few days, which can be done by almost everyone. -1 Simple Most people can do this without much effort. _ Easy Even untrained people still can do these tasks most of the time. +1 Normal You need at least some training to complete these kind of tasks. +2 Demanding You either need gear or good training for these tasks. +3 Challenging You need a lot of training and good gear. +4 Hard You need to be a specialist for these tasks. +5 Very Hard You require help from others to achieve this. +6 Impossible A once in a lifetime achievement. Difficulty Modifier \u00b6 Certain circumstances modify the task\u2019s difficulty positively or negatively. Multiple modifiers stack. Modifier Name Description +1 Asset Having the correct tools at hand. -1 Unfavorable Circumstance E.g. climbing a cliff while it\u2019s raining. Stacking Modifiers Even though modifiers stack, multiple assets of the same type may not be stacking. Turns \u00b6 Each character and creature in a crisis have one turn per round. The order in which they can act are determined by their turn order. Every Action in a Crisis requires Actions Points (AP). Action points can never exceed 6 or deceed 0. Exceeding AP are lost, while actions that require more than the remain AP are disabled until enough AP are accumulated. Turn Order \u00b6 Every character involved in a crisis uses its Perception value to determine its turn order. The character with the highest Perception value acts first. Once every character has acted, a new turn begins. If two or more characters have rolled the same result the PCs can agree upon who acts first. If they cannot find an agreement make a Task roll on your Speed Attribute. The characters retain their original roll, but rolls to resolve the conflict change the turn order. Action Points \u00b6 Every character has a minimum of 0 AP and a maximum of 6 AP. At the start of each turn, including the beginning of a Crisis, the character gains 4 AP. Exceeding AP are lost, while Actions that require more than the remaining AP are disabled until enough AP are accumulated. If an Action states an AP cost higher than 6, this indicates that the Action has to be executed over multiple subsequent turns. Executing any other Action while this Action isn\u2019t completed yet cancels it. Reloading a flintlock musket Reloading a flintlock musket takes 10 AP. You can immediatly spend all your AP on reloading. Each subsequent turn you can spend another 4 AP on reloading. A character begins reloading a flintlock musket with 3 AP left. After 2 more rounds he would have accumulated 11 AP. So after these 2 rounds he has 1 AP left and his weapon is reloaded. Actions in parallel Not all Actions require your utmost attention. E.g. while reloading you can still give short commands to e.g. other party members. This is up to the GM however. Surprise Round \u00b6 If you attack an enemy who has not noticed you and is not combat ready, you gain an additional turn before actual combat starts. Attacks \u00b6 An Attack roll is equal to a Task roll, using the weapon\u2019s associated Skill. Making an Attack Attack \u00b1 Hit \u00b1 Circumstance Melee Attacks \u00b6 A melee Attack roll has to be equal to or higher than the target\u2019s Parry value. Ranged Attacks \u00b6 A ranged Attack roll has to be equal to or higher than 4. Circumstances such as range, visibility, wind, etc. influence the Attack roll\u2019s result. Critical Hits \u00b6 For every 4 points above 12, starting at 12, you score a Critical Hit, if the Attack is higher than the target\u2019s armor. Scoring a Critical Hit gives you a +1 bonus on Damage rolls. You only score a Critical Hit, if the Attack itself hits and a Critical Hit can only be scored, if the threshold for a Critical Hit is higher than the target\u2019s armor. Critical Hits Jack attacks and his Attack roll results in 19. His target has a Defence of 13. He scores only 1 Critical Hit, for reach 16. Reaching the 12 is not a Critical Hit, since it\u2019s lower than the target\u2019s armor. Area of Effect \u00b6 Attacks with an Area of Effect, e.g. a fireball spell, always deal their damage without having to roll for an Attack. As such, they cannot critically hit. Thrown weapons, e.g. grenades, require you to make an Athletics check. The roll otherwise is a normal Ranged Attack. Circumstances such as range, visibility, wind, etc. influence the Athletics roll\u2019s result. Cover \u00b6 Cover provides additional defensive bonuses for melee and ranged combat. Cover is always relative to other targets. A character can be in total cover for an enemy, but in plain sight for another. Modifier Condition +1 Cover +2 Heavy Cover unhittable Total Cover Positions and Cover Being prone and facing an enemy straight on counts as being in heavy cover (only head and shoulds visible). Cover and firearms When hiding behind materials that are penetrable by bullets or other projectiles decrease your Cover by one step. E.g. total cover becomes heavy cover, while in in light cover you count as not being behind cover at all. Damage \u00b6 If an Attack is successful, damage can be dealt to the target. Roll the weapon\u2019s damage dice. Some weapons gain additional damage from an Attribute and Actions. The result of the damage roll has to be higher than the target\u2019s Toughness value. If the damage roll is higher, you cause 1 wound, or more depending on the weapon and used Action, to the target. Additional Damage \u00b6 For each 4 points above the target\u2019s Toughness value, the target receives 1 additional wound. These additional wounds are always physical wounds. Damage Reduction \u00b6 If a target wears Armor, all wounds you deal are substracted from the target\u2019s Armor first. Only if the Durability of the Weapon\u2019s or Action\u2019s Damage type is 0 you can deal wounds to the target. Some weapons and Actions circumvent the Armor, e.g. Armor-Piercing Ammunition. Non-lethal damage \u00b6 When a target would die from an Attack, the attacker can decide whether or not to apply non-lethal force, knocking the target unconcious instead of killing it. Wounds \u00b6 When the creature has negative Health equal to its maximum, the creature dies. If Health drops to 0 or below, the creature has to make a Might roll. On a failure, the creature becomes incapacitated, but not necessarily unconcious, until healed or dead. NPCs usually die outright when they reach 0 Health . Negative Health Jack has a maximum of 3 Health . At 0 Health he becomes incapacitated if he fails his Might roll. When his Health drop to -3, Jack dies. Healing \u00b6 The Medicine Skill can be used to treat a wound suffered within the last hour. Each Medicine Skill roll to heal a wound takes 10 minutes. Wounds that are older than one hour have to heal naturally. Healing A Character : A healer can aid a character\u2019s healing progress. The healer has to substract the patient\u2019s wounds from his Medicine roll. A wounded character trying to heal his own wounds suffers from both the wound penalty and a -2 penalty for treating himself. Without any healing aids, such as bandages etc., the healer suffers a -2 penalty to his roll. Having the right tools at hand via an Asset, the penalty is reduced to 0, rather than a +1 bonus. If the Medicine check was successful, the patient recovers from 1 wound. Healing A Dying Character : If a healer was successful on his Medicine check for his patient, the patient is not incapacitated anymore. Natural Healing \u00b6 Every day a wounded or incapacitated character can attempt a Might roll to heal 1 wound naturally. A critical failure on the Might roll causes an additional wound. The difficulty of Natural Healing is influenced by these conditions: Modifier Condition -2 Rough traveling -2 No medical attention -2 Poor environmental conditions, such as intense cold, heat, or rain _ First Aid / Medical attention from self +1 Medical attention from a doctor +2 Medical attention from a doctor in good condition, such as a hospital Available Actions \u00b6 All characters can perform basic actions. Talents and Equipment can make additional actions available. This list provides a guideline for actions and their AP cost. These apply unless stated otherwise, e.g. attacking with an oversized weapon may require more AP. Movement & Stances \u00b6 Move \u00b6 You can move up to the character\u2019s Pace . AP Cost 1 Crawl \u00b6 You can move up to 2 meters while crawling. Effect Ranged attacks against you suffer a -2 penalty. AP Cost 1 Crouch \u00b6 You can move up to half the character\u2019s Pace . Effect Ranged attacks against you suffer a -1 penalty. Also counts as sneaking. AP Cost 1 Kneel down / Stand Up \u00b6 You kneel down on your kneews or stand up. Effect Toggles the Kneeling Condition. When Kneeling, going prone only costs 1 AP. AP Cost 1 Go Prone / Stand Up \u00b6 You lie down or stand up. Effect Toggles the Prone Condition. When being prone, kneeling down costs 1 AP. AP Cost 2 Combat \u00b6 Attack \u00b6 Attack with a normal weapon. AP Cost 2, or as indicated by the weapon. Hide \u00b6 Hide from others, provided they have no direct vision of you. AP Cost 3 Overwatch \u00b6 You delay your turn and can use your AP for Attack actions in somebody else\u2019s turn. AP Cost - Take Aim \u00b6 Line up your shot. Can be used multiple times. Effect Per Take Aim action you gain a +1 bonus to ranged attacks. AP Cost 2, or as indicated by the weapon. Use Item \u00b6 You use an item. Effect The used item specifies the effect of this action. AP Cost 2, or as indicated by the item. Conditions \u00b6 Certain actions become available or unavailable when characters are affected by various conditions. Conditions can be inflicted by other characters, by themselves or the environment. Drunk \u00b6 Penalty All checks suffer a -1 penalty. Checks that rely on speed and balance suffer a -2 penalty. Exhausted \u00b6 Penalty You gain -2 AP per round. Kneeling \u00b6 Kneeling down gives you better control over recoil and weapon sway. Bonus You count as being in Light Cover against ranged Attacks. You gain a +1 bonus on attacks using ranged weapons. Penalty Melee attacks against you gain a +2 bonus. Prone \u00b6 Being prone gives gives you even better control over recoil and weapon sway. Bonus You count as being in Heavy Cover against ranged Attacks. You gain a +2 bonus on attacks using ranged weapons. Penalty Melee attacks against you gain a +4 bonus. Stunned \u00b6 Penalty You can\u2019t act or react on the current turn and do not regain AP.","title":"Crisis"},{"location":"crisis/#crisis","text":"A crisis requires a character to make a Task roll, Damage roll or Random roll.

If more items can be bougth with the provided price, the table shows the amount under the # column. An item is made up by these statistics: Cost, Weight, and Bulk. Some items require additional Acquisitions to be unlocked, maintained or bought. If an item doesn\u2019t have a Weight specified, it still uses Bulk. Assets Some items count as Assets, which can be used to provide a bonus on a Task rollfor related checks. Usually an item states if it\u2019s an Asset, but creative use can always turn other items into Assets as well! Credits \u00b6 Credits are a universal currency for buying most things. All items cost Credits , while some items may cost Resources instead or in addition. This Resources cost abstract the maintenance of an item, e.g. ammunition, cleaning, restocking etc. Whenever there is a cost listed without units, then Credits are used. Weight \u00b6 An item can specify it\u2019s Weight. The Weight value indicates the minimum Might needed to use the item. If this level of Might is not met, the item cannot be used effectively in combat. If the Weight column shows zero or has no Weight, then its Weight can be disregarded. Using a normally one-handed item with two hands increases the level of Might by one step. Weight Requirements A one-handed wooden club specifies it\u2019s Weight as a d8 . The character only has a d6 in Might , so he uses the club in both hands increasing his Might to a d8 . For the purpose of wielding, attacking and dealing damage with the club, the character\u2019s Might is considered to be a d8 . Overburdened \u00b6 Only items that are equipped, e.g. wielded weapons, worn armour and outfits, etc. are subject to this rule. An item that\u2019s kept in the character\u2019s inventory is not influencing the character. An item\u2019s Weight exceeding the character\u2019s Might incures penalties. For each step of the character\u2019s Might below the item\u2019s Weight, the character\u2019s: Speed is reduced by one level to a minimum of a d4 , and the character\u2019s Parry and Defence suffers -1. Overburdened All skills related to the Speed Attribute that are higher than the new Speed also drop to the new level. Bulk \u00b6 An item that specifies it\u2019s Bulk takes up that much Inventory Space. Ten light items specified by a Bulk value of L count as 1 Bulk. Some items\u2019 Bulk are negligible; they do not list their Bulk value. You can carry up an amount of Bulk equal to your Might without penalty; if you carry more you gain the Slowed condition. You can\u2019t hold or carry more Bulk than twice your Might . Looting items \u00b6 Usually looting only gives you Loot . If you are looking for certain items that, for example, your enemies may have, you can loot them normally. As soon as this happens though, you cannot get Loot from the enemies anymore, only their items. If a looted item requires Resources a character may spend his available Resources on it to keep it. If the character does not have enough Resources to pay for the item at the end of the current session, the item is lost. Equipment condition \u00b6 An item can have a condition, making it better or worse. The item condition only changes the item\u2019s durability and price. Weapons \u00b6 All melee weapons use the Melee skill, while ranged weapons use the Light weapon skill, unless otherwise noted. HIT indicates the bonus or penalty the Attack Skill roll receives. DMG indicates the dice for the damage roll. RNG indicates the weapon\u2019s range increment. Each increment imposes a -1 penalty to the attack. MAG provides the number of magazines.

If something is unclear, look up the full rules!","title":"Quick Start Rules"},{"location":"character/","text":"Character \u00b6 Every player character, non-player character (NPC) and creature such as animals, monsters or even robots, etc. fall under this category and are created using the following rules. Race \u00b6 See Races . Skills \u00b6 See Skills . Talents \u00b6 See Talents . Attributes \u00b6 Attributes define the character\u2019s overall physique and mental capabilities. As such they count as the cornerstone for a character\u2019s Skill. Every character starts with each Attribute at a d4 , with a d6 in each Attribute being the average for an adult human. Upgrading an Attribute allows the character to use a d6 , a d8 , a d10 or a d12 . You cannot raise an Attribute above a d12 . Attribute Damage \u00b6 Attribute Damage decreases the character\u2019s Attribute, e.g. from a d6 to a d4 . This penalty can be temporary or permanently . Attribute Damage does not influence any Skills, but improving associated Skills might cost 2 points instead of one, even if the Attribute Damage is only temporary. Might (MI) \u00b6 Might represents the character\u2019s physical strength and resilience. The damage of melee weapons is derived from Might . Also improves a character\u2019s toughness. Speed (SP) \u00b6 Speed measures the character\u2019s reflexes and eye-hand coordination. Speed adds a bonus to ranged weapon attacks, is used for stealth and lets you act in a Crisis sooner. Intelligence (IN) \u00b6 Intelligence describes how well your character learns new things, and how well he remembers already existing things. Intelligence improves a character\u2019s Attribute to assess situations and skills related to knowing things. Charisma (CH) \u00b6 Charisma represents the character\u2019s physical attractiveness, force of personality and his ability to lead. Charisma is mostly used in social interactions between characters and NPCs. Stats \u00b6 Pace \u00b6 The Pace gives you an estimate how long it takes to go from A to B. It\u2019s used to determine how far the creature gets by using the Move Action. Pace 2 + Die / 2 Perception \u00b6 Perception is a passive value that represents the character\u2019s alertness. It\u2019s used to passively counter creatures that used the Stealth Skill , sense things and creatures, etc. Perception 2 + Die / 2 Parry \u00b6 The Parry value is used for defending against a melee Attack. The Parry value is 2 if you don\u2019t have the Melee Skill. Parry Value 2 + Die / 2 Toughness \u00b6 The Toughness value is used for shrugging off Attacks. The Toughness value can never drop below 2 . Toughness Value 2 + Die / 2 + TN Health (HP) \u00b6 Health represents the character\u2019s overall condition. If Health drops to 0 or below, the creature has to make a Might roll. On a failure, the creature becomes incapacitated, but not necessarily unconcious, until healed or dead. A character that drops to or below his HP in negative dies. Health 1 + Die / 2 Experience (XP) \u00b6 Experience Points (XP) are gained throughout a character\u2019s adventuring career. XP are gained due to noteable achievements or story completions. XP usually are only given out one at a time. The GM can decide to give out more for completing a longer adventure. You need twice your Level as XP to increase your Level by one. Experience and Level Ups Level x2 = Level Up Every three Experience Points (XP) increase a character\u2019s level by one. Level (LVL) \u00b6 The Level of a character abstracts it\u2019s experience, resourcefulness, and skill set. Acquisitions \u00b6 A character\u2019s level improves the maximum values of his acquisitions. This does not necessarily make the character stronger, but makes the character more resourceful and adaptable. Character Points \u00b6 Every level, a character gains 1 Skill Point. Every 2 levels, a character gains 1 Attribute Point. Every 4 levels, a character gains a Talent. Fate \u00b6 A character can change the course of action and his fate. Every character has a few fate dice available, a d4 , d6 , d8 , d10 and a d12 . Any of these dice can only be used once. A fate die can be used on any roll, even multiple fate dice can be used at once. Before rolling determine if you want to use fate dice and which fate dice you want to use. Add the fate dice to your roll. Acquisitions \u00b6 Acquisitions abstract the resources available to a character. Acquisitions are limited by a maximum value, and are used to improve your character. This maximum value is modified by Circumstances, Perks , and permanently due to Experience . The current value for Acquisitions can never exceed the maximum value. All exceeding points are usually lost. Influence , Resources and Technology can be traded for each other. Any two Acquisitions of one sort can be traded in for any other. Downtime cannot be traded. Buying Acquisitions A GM may disallow exchanging Credits for Acquisitions directly. Instead, he may require a character or the party to go on a quest or adventure in order to exchange Credits . E.g. the party has to find a wealthy trader, or rescue a trader from pirates first, etc. Loot (LOOT) \u00b6 Loot abstracts the items and clutter looted. 1 unit of Loot takes up 1 Bulk. Loot is usually stored on a vessel or a player base. Loot can be sold or exchanged for other Acquisitions. Loot cannot be bought. Loot Exchanges to 1 1 000 Credits 5 1 Resource 10 1 Technology Downtime (DT) \u00b6 Downtime represents the time a character can invest in Downtime activities. GAINED over the course of time. A character gains more Downtime in between adventures and longer periods of downtime during adventures. A character gains at least 1 Downtime each session automatically. USED to recuperate, craft, repair and upgrade items and vessels and to improve a character. Maximum Downtime 10 Influence (INF) \u00b6 Influence represents connections, owed favours by others, fame and infamy. GAINED by making a name for yourself in the cosmos, i.e. by helping people and factions. Influence is lost by harming and disappointing others. USED for accessing and buying items, vessels, meetings with high ranking characters, etc. More Influence unlocks better equipment and better vessels. Traders may also give you better prices. Maximum Influence LVL + 2 \u00b1 Resources (RES) \u00b6 Resources represent materials used for creating, repairing, upgrading and acquiring equipment. GAINED by looting, or completing missions, adventures and quests. USED to create, repair, upgrade and acquire equipment and vessels. Resources can be used to repair vessels, in which case the Resources are spent on the repair. If Resources are spent on equipment, your maximum Resources are temporarily lowered by that amount. This abstracts the upkeep of a powerful item. Powerful equipment requiring Resources usually adds stunts or other benefits. Maximum Resources LVL + 2 \u00b1 Technology (TECH) \u00b6 Technology represents the character\u2019s technological knowledge, which on the other hand allows to unlock new Equipment . GAINED by aiding science missions, acquiring blueprints, spending time on researching certain scientific fields, etc. USED for unlocking experimental equipment and vessels. Once unlocked, the experimental equipment or vessel can be acquired. Certain ugprades require Technology in order to be unlocked. Upgrades have to be unlocked only once, and can be shared between characters. Unlocking upgrades enables the acquisition of better equipment and vessels. Maximum Technology LVL + 2 \u00b1 Living standard \u00b6 Every character has a normal living standard by default. This living standard includes normal accomadations, free food and drinks in populated areas, moving in local traffic and areas, etc. This means you don\u2019t have to pay for normal lodging, etc. Languages \u00b6 A language can be learned in three steps: speaking, writing, and reading. Every character has at least one native language with all three steps unlocked. Learning a Language can be done in three steps, whereas each step costs 2 Downtime to learn: Reading Speaking Writing Learning a Language completely (all three steps) at once only costs 5 Downtime instead.
