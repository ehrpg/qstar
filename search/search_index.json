A GM also requires these\ndice, or even more, to roll for NPCs, random outcomes, etc. A d20 or d100 also\ncan be useful when rolling on random tables.\n\n\nMechanics\n\n\nA character\ns skill and attributes are defined by his skill and attribute level.\nEvery character starts with a skill and attribute level at d4. This can be\nimproved up to a d12, or even higher adding flat bonuses, e.g. d12+1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA task\ns difficulty is always 4. The only exceptions are passive values in\ncombat, e.g. a character\ns defense value.\n\n\nCircumstances can modify a task\ns difficulty, so it becomes easier or harder to\nmaster.\n\n\nChecks\n\n\nChecks are made if the outcome of a task is uncertain and subject to chance, or\ninfluenced by others. A check involves rolling the character\ns die corresponding\nto the attempted skill or attribute roll. Bonuses are added to the resulting die\nroll, and compared to the task\ns difficulty level.\n\n\nWhenever a die is rolled with it\ns highest possible result (e.g. rolling a 12 on\na d12), the die \nexplodes\n. This allows you to roll the die again, and add the\nresult to your check. A die can explode multiple times.\n\n\nThe higher the resulting number, the better.\n\n\nA check has to be equal to or higher a target number in order to succeed.\nOtherwise, the check fails. The target number is derived from the task attempted\nand the check made. Most checks are made for \nSkills\n\nand \nAttributes\n.\n\n\nCheck Failures\n\n\nA failed check doesn\nt necessarily mean, that the check completely failed. E.g.\nwhen climbing, a failed check might simply mean, that there was no progress\nwhile climbing. Or a failed sailing check might mean, that the voyage took a few\ndays longer.\n\n\nContests\n\n\nWhen two parties compete with each other in the same or even different skills\nand stats, both parties have to make a check. The party with the higher result\nwins the contest. On a tie both parties roll again.\n\n\nDifficulty Level\n\n\nEvery Check has to beat a set \nDifficulty Level\n in order to\nbe successful. The \nDifficulty Level\n is influenced by\ncircumstances, increasing or decreasing the difficulty.\n\n\nContests\n don\nt use \nDifficulty Levels\n. \nContests\n are\nused, when both parties are \nactive\n (rather than one party being \npassive\n) and\nhave to make a check and compare the results to see who is successful.\n\n\nNPCs are abstracted by a \nDifficulty Level\n, and use this\nlevel for almost all checks, stats, etc.\n\n\nDifficulty Modifier\n\n\nA \nDifficulty Level\n can \nnever\n shift more than 2 levels\nin any direction.\n\n\nIf a creative idea of a player would accomplish the same task and leaves little\nto no room of error, then the GM \ncan\n decide what to do.

As\nsuch they count as the cornerstone for a character\ns Skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery character starts with each Attribute at a d4. Upgrading an Attribute\nallows the character to use a d6, a d8, a d10 or a d12. Upgrading an Attribute\nbeyond a d12 adds a flat bonus of +1 per upgrade to the check.\n\n\nUpgrading an Attribute by one step costs \n6\n\n\nDowntime\n.\n\n\nDowngrading only happens due to \nfatal\n adventuring events.\n\n\nAttribute Damage\n\n\nAttribute Damage decreases the character\ns Attribute, e.g. from a d6 to a d4.\nThis penalty can be \ntemporary\n or \npermanently\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf an Attribute were to drop below a d4 the character is incapacitated until\nthe Attribute Damage is restored. If the Attribute Damage cannot be restored by\n\nany\n means, the character dies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMight (MI)\n\n\n\n\nMight represents the character\ns physical strength and resilience.\n\n\n\n\nThe damage of melee weapons is derived from might. Also improves a character\ns\ntoughness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeed (SP)\n\n\n\n\nSpeed measures the character\ns reflexes and eye-hand coordination.\n\n\n\n\nSpeed adds a bonus to ranged weapon attacks, is used for stealth and lets you\nact in a \nCrisis\n sooner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntelligence (IN)\n\n\n\n\nIntelligence describes how well your character learns new things, and how well\nhe remembers already existing things.\n\n\n\n\nIntelligence improves a character\ns Attribute to assess situations and skills\nrelated to knowing things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharisma (CH)\n\n\n\n\nCharisma represents the character\ns physical attractiveness, force of personality\nand his Attribute to lead.\n\n\n\n\nCharisma is mostly used in social interactions between characters and NPCs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMovement Speed\n\n\nA creature\ns Movement Speed is derived from the creature\ns Speed Attribute.\nEvery creature has a base Movement Speed of 4 units per move action. Each step\nabove a d4 adds one to the Movement Speed. E.g. a creature with a d12 in Speed\nhas a Movement Speed of 8. A creature with a d12+2 in Speed has a Movement Speed\nof 10.\n\n\nTraits, Races, Items and Equipment can also increase a creature\ns Movement\nSpeed.\n\n\n\n\nMovement Speed\n\n\n\n    \n4\n +\n    \nSpeed\n +\n    \nCircumstance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerception\n\n\nPerception is a passive value that represents the character\ns alertness.

Once depleted, the health pool is\ntargetted. \nHealth\n is very hard to replenish.\n\n\n\n\nHealth (HP)\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n represents the character\ns overall condition.\n\n\n\n\nIf \nHealth\n drops to zero or below, the character is\n\ndying\n. A \ndying\n character has to make a \nMight\n check the\nfirst time he drops to or below zero, and every time he receives damage while in\na \ndying\n state. On a failed check the character falls unconcious. If the check\nsucceeds, the character retains conciousnes.\n\n\nOutside of combat, a \ndying\n character loses one HP per minute, until he\nreceives medical attention.\n\n\nA character that drops to or below his HP in negative dies.\n\n\n\n\nMaximum \nHealth\n\n\n\n    \n12\n \u00b1\n    \nMight\n\n    \nx2\n\n    \n \u00b1\n    \nCircumstance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndurance (EP)\n\n\n\n\nEndurance\n represents the character\ns power.\n\n\n\n\nDamage from weapons, other characters, environments and certain actions such as\nsprinting cause stress on a character and reduce his\n\nEndurance\n.\n\n\n\n\nMaximum \nEndurance\n\n\n\n    \n30\n \u00b1\n    \nMight\n\n    \nx5\n\n    \n \u00b1\n    \nCircumstance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperience (XP)\n\n\n\n\nExperience is gained throughout a character\ns adventuring career.\n\n\n\n\nExperience (XP) is gained due to noteable achievements or story completions. XP\nusually is only given out one at a time. The GM can decide to give out more for\ncompleting a longer adventure.\n\n\n\n\nEvery character has 0 XP upon creation.\n\n\n\n\nEvery three Experience Points (XP) increase a character\ns level by one.\n\n\nLevel (LVL)\n\n\nA character\ns level improves the maximum values of his currencies. This does not\nnecessarily make the character stronger, but make the character more resourceful\nand adaptable.\n\n\nFate\n\n\n\n\nA character can change the course of action and his fate.\n\n\n\n\nEvery character has one fate roll available. Each level up adds another fate\nroll. Once used, a fate roll can never be regained.\n\n\nAcquisitions\n\n\n\n\nAcquisitions abstract the resources available to a character.\n\n\n\n\nAcquisitions are limited by a maximum value, and are used to improve your\ncharacter. This maximum value is modified by Circumstances, \nPerks\n, and\npermanently due to \nExperience\n.\n\n\nThe current value for Acquisitions can \nnever\n exceed the maximum value. All\nexceeding points are usually lost.\n\n\nInfluence\n, \nResources\n and\n\nTechnology\n can be traded for each other. Any two\nAcquisitions of one sort can be traded in for any other.\n\nDowntime\n cannot be traded.\n\n\n\n\nBuying Acquisitions\n\n\nA GM may disallow exchanging \nCredits\n for Acquisitions\ndirectly. Instead, he may require a character or the party to go on a quest\nor adventure in order to exchange \nCredits\n. E.g. the\nparty has to find a wealthy trader, or rescue a trader from pirates first,\netc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDowntime (DT)\n\n\n\n\nDowntime\n represents the time a character can invest in\n\nDowntime\n activities.\n\n\n\n\nGAINED\n over the course of time. A character gains more\n\nDowntime\n in between adventures and longer periods of downtime\nduring adventures.

Usually, a task that consumes \nDowntime\n\nhas at least a DC of 12. Better skill checks can reduce \nDowntime\n\nand/or \nResources\n  used, while bad skill checks can\nincrease \nDowntime\n and/or \nResources\n\nused.

At the start of each turn, including the\nbeginning of a crisis, the character gains 4 AP. Action points can never exceed\n6 or deceed 0. Exceeding AP are lost, while actions that require more than the\nremain AP are disabled until enough AP are accumulated.\n\n\n\n\nTracking AP\n\n\nTracking AP is very easy. Get a d6, put it front of you, and let it face the\nnumber of AP your character has. If you are at zero AP, put the die aside.\n\n\n\n\nIf an action states an AP cost higher than 6, this indicates that the action has\nto be executed over multiple subsequent turns.

Jack is a good melee fighter and has a \ndefence vs\nmelee\n of 16 against a single enemy.

Hiding behind a car in a firefight would only\nprovide normal cover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDamage\n\n\nIf an attack hits a target, damage is dealt to it. The amount of damage done\ndepends on the weapon used. The damage of weapons can be influenced by the\ncharacter using them, e.g. when wielding a melee weapon which is influenced by\n\nMight\n.\n\n\nThere are two types of damage: \nEndurance\n damage,\nindicated by a weapon\ns \nEND\n stat, and \nHealth\n damage,\nindicated by the \nDMG\n stat.\n\n\nA character\ns \nEndurance\n has to be depleted or\n\nCritical Hits\n have to be dealt to the character in order\nto deal damage to the character\ns \nHealth\n pool.\n\n\n\n\nDealing damage\n\n\n\n    \nDamage\n \u00b1\n    \nAttribute\n \u00b1\n    \nCircumstance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDamage reduces the character\ns \nEndurance\n. When the\n\nEndurance\n pool reaches zero, the character becomes\nexhausted.\n\n\nOnce \nEndurance\n has reached 0, all attacks that hit\nare critical hits. Damage that first exceeds\n\nEndurance\n doesn\nt have any special effect.\n When\nthe \nHealth\n pool reaches zero, the character is dead.\n\n\nAn armour prevents damage to the character\ns \nHealth\n\npool, provided it still has Durability left. Whenever an armour prevents\n\nHealth\n damage, it loses one Durability. E.g. two\ncritical hits would reduce an amour\ns Durability by 2.\n\n\nCritical damage\n\n\nCritical Hits\n deal the weapon\ns damage to the target\ns\n\nHealth\n pool.\n\n\nHealing\n\n\nEndurance\n is restored over time. Items such as\n\nAdrenalin Shots\n increase\n\nEndurance\n instantly. Usually, taking a 10 minute\nbreak restores all \nEndurance\n. The time required\nvaries, as e.g. a long march requires more time to restore\n\nEndurance\n.\n\n\nHealth\n is restored slowly over time. A character heals 1\npoint of \nHealth\n damage every day they can take a rest.\nResting Acquisitions that the character can only do light downtime activities, like\nreading.\n\n\nHealing a dying character\n\n\nA \ndying\n character requires medical attention from any other character or even\nhimself. Using the \nScience (Medicine)\n skill is required to treat a \ndying\n\ncharacter. The check is penalized by the amount of negative HP the target has.\n\n\nIf a character tries to medically treat himself, the check receives a penalty of\n5 points.\n\n\nFirst Aid requires one minute. If the check fails, the character loses one HP\ndue to \ndying\n. First Aid can be attempted multiple times, until the character\nis healed or \ndead\n.\n\n\nA \ndying\n character can be administered a medical item instead of rolling for\nFirst Aid.\n\n\nHealing a wounded character\n\n\nMedical installations, doctors and medical supplies increase the amount of\n\nHealth\n healed. Per day a \nScience (Medicine)\n check\ncan be attempted for a single character.\n\n\nTranslate the result of the check to the \nDifficulty Level\n of the\n\nDifficulty\n table.
