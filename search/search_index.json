A fate roll allows a character to\n\nre-roll\n the entire check (all 3d6). Using a fate roll consumes one\n\nExperience\n. Using fate can reduce a character\ns\nlevel. Fate cannot be used if you have zero\n\nExperience\n Points.\n\n\nFate helps powerful characters to get a better outcome when faced with dire\nconsequences, but changing fate always comes with a cost.\n\n\nMeans\n\n\n\n\nMeans abstract the resources available to a character.\n\n\n\n\nMeans are limited by a maximum value, and are used to improve your character.\nThis maximum value is modified by Circumstances, \nPerks\n, and\npermanently due to \nExperience\n.\n\n\nThe current value for Means can \nnever\n exceed the maximum value.

Usually, a task that consumes \nDowntime\n\nhas at least a DC of 12. Better skill checks can reduce \nDowntime\n\nand/or \nResources\n  used, while bad skill checks can\nincrease \nDowntime\n and/or \nResources\n\nused.
