It\u2019s heavily enspired by great RPGs and RPG systems such as Divinity: Original Sin, Dungeons & Dragons, Mindjammer, Fragged Empire, Savage Worlds, How to be a hero, etc. It aims to provide an RPG system that\u2019s usable for any kind of play and for any setting such as medieval, fantasy, modern, sci-fi settings or even a combination of any of these, although the base rule set is built with mainly modern and sci-fi settings in mind. Skills , Traits , Perks , Flaws , Races , and Equipment are heavily influenced by the setting. Preface \u00b6 Reading the rules \u00b6 Terms that are game related, e.g. \u201c Skills \u201d, or \u201cCrisis\u201d, are either easily recognisable by an icon, are links, or are in uppercase. Distances, Pace, Range, etc. are all refering to tiles. A tile spans roughly 5 feet or 1,5 meters in the \u201creal world\u201d. Terminology \u00b6 \u201cIncreases\u201d and \u201cdecreases\u201d changes the inherent value of e.g. a Skill . It\u2019s changed for all circumstances, just as if a character would have improved the Skill . \u201cReceive a bonus\u201d and \u201csuffer a penalty\u201d only lower a single roll, not a value. They refer to Modifiers . Prerequisites \u00b6 Dice \u00b6 All players and the GM need one of each of the following dice: a d4 , a d6 , a d8 , a d10 and a d12 . A GM should also have a d20 and a d100 to roll on random tables. Basics \u00b6 Every character uses a d4 , d6 , d8 , d10 and a d12 for everything he\u2019s doing. Every roll is made with a single die. The more sides the die has the better the chance on rolling higher , which is better . 7.5 All fractions are always rounded down. When an Attribute or Skill is divided, divide the number of sides of the die. Flat modifiers are added to the sides of the die before the sides are divided. Skill Fraction ( d12 + 3 ) / 2 = 7 -1 Some values cannot be negative, e.g. Resources . The minimum value is always 0, unless otherwise stated. Most of the formulas and values can be influenced by circumstance, such as racial traits, talents, equipment, environmental factors such as bad or particularly good visibility, wind, etc. Dice \u00b6 A die roll is described by expressions such as 3d6+12 . This expression means \u201croll three six-sided dice add them together, then add 12\u201d. The first number indicates the amount of dice that have to be rolled. The number after the d indicates how many sides the individual die has to have. Anything after that indicates if you add or substract the specified value from the die roll. A d% is called percentile die. You roll two ten-sided dice (or 2d10 ). Before you roll, designate one of the two to be the tens digit; the other is ones digit. Two 0s represent 100. There are also percentile dice, where one of the two already shows the tens, which makes rolling a bit easier. Natural Rolls \u00b6 A natural roll is an unmodified roll. It\u2019s the numbers you see printed on the dice you rolled, without adding any bonuses or substracing any penalties. Critical Failures \u00b6 Whenever a die is rolled and shows a 1 , the die implodes . Roll again; if it\u2019s another 1 the check critically fails. Otherwise add your modifiers to your first roll, the 1 . The check can still succeed this way, provided you have enough positive modifiers. A critical fail can not be prevented by any means, and the character has to suffer the consequences of the outcome. Critical Successes \u00b6 Whenever a die is rolled with its highest possible result (e.g. rolling a 10 on a d10 ), the die explodes . This allows you to roll the die again, and add the result to your check. A die can explode multiple times. Exploding Dice d6 + d6 + d6 = 15 Task Difficulty \u00b6 Any task\u2019s Difficulty Level is usually 4. If a Task is exceptionally difficult or easy, the Difficulty Level can be adjusted by the GM. A check has to be equal to or higher this Difficulty Level in order to succeed. Otherwise, the check fails. Circumstances modify the check positively or negatively. Check Failures A failed check doesn\u2019t necessarily mean, that the check completely failed. E.g. when climbing, a failed check might simply mean, that there was no progress while climbing. Or a failed sailing check might mean, that the voyage takes a few days longer. Contests \u00b6 When two parties compete with each other in the same Skill or even different Skills and stats, both parties have to roll. The party with the higher result wins the contest. On a tie both parties roll again. Typical contests are: Melee attack vs. Parrying, Bluffing vs. Empathy, Stealth vs. Perception. Modifiers \u00b6 There are different types of modifiers that can influence almost any value in the game. Modifiers are described by different types and origins. An origin describes where modifier is coming from, e.g. an item, a race, weather, etc. The type describes how the modifier influences the value. If multiple modifiers have the same type and the same origin, they do not stack; in that case only the highest bonus or penalty counts. Multiple modifiers of a different type or origin stack. The modifier types are: Enhancement modifier, Morale modifier, Racial modifier, and Circumstancial modifier; this is the default if no type is named. Modifier types and origins A modifier origin could be an Asset, e.g. Climbing Gear, and its modifier type is Circumstancial. A dwarf may get a positive modifier for knowledge about stones; the modifier origin is the race (dwarf) and its type is Racial. Multipliers \u00b6 If you multiply dice, roll the dice a number of times specified by the multiplier, e.g. for d4 times 2 you roll 2d4 , and add the result together. Multiplying modifiers works as usual, e.g. a +2 times 2 becomes a +4 . Multiple multipliers don\u2019t multiply each other. E.g. two doubles result in a triple, not a quadruple. Each extra multiple adds 1 less than its value to the first multiple. E.g. a triple times a double would result in a quadruple ( \u00d73 + \u00d71 = \u00d74 ).","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Q* is an easy-to-learn and adaptable RPG system for games such as pen and paper games.

Fatigue points reduces your character\u2019s abilities and can even kill him. Fatigue is messured in steps, whereas each fatigue point progresses them by one. A character becomes fatigued with one fatigue point; exhausted with 2 fatigue points; and incapacitated with 3 fatigue points. Fatigue points are accumulated across hazards. Fatigued \u00b6 All Attribute rolls, Skill rolls, etc. suffer a -1 penalty. If a fatigued character receives another fatigue point, he becomes exhausted. Exhausted \u00b6 All Attribute rolls, Skill rolls, etc. suffer a -2 penalty. If an exhausted character receives another fatigue point, he becomes incapacitated. Incapacitated \u00b6 The character becomes incapacitated and cannot act anymore. Depending on the hazard, this state has different outcomes. Recovery \u00b6 Each Hazard lists how to recover from the accumulated fatigue points. If no method of recovery is specified, then simply resting for 8 hours recovers a single fatigue point. Hazards \u00b6 Cold \u00b6 All temperatures below 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F) are considered severe cold. Every four hours in severe cold requires you to make a Body check with a Difficulty Level of 4. Each 4 Cold DR adds +2 to the check. If the character does not wear warm clothing the check suffers a -2 penalty. For every 10\u00b0C (18\u00b0F) below freezing you suffer a -1 penalty (max -3). If you fail the check, you receive a fatigue point. Recovery Warmth and shelter recovers one fatigue point received from Cold every 30 minutes. Incapacitation You have to make a Body check every hour with all modifiers listed above. On a failed check you die. Disease \u00b6 Depending on the disease a fatigue point has different outcomes. The disease also states the Attribute used for the checks, the frequency of rolling on the Attribute , the modifiers for each roll, and how it can be treated. Drowning \u00b6 Every minute you have to make an Athletics check. Depending on the water this check suffers penalties or receives bonuses. A failed check adds one fatigue point. Recovery Every five minutes out of liquid substances you recover from a fatigue point. Incapacitation The character dies. Within five minutes a healer can resuscitated the character with a Medicine check and a -4 penalty on the roll. Falling \u00b6 Per 2 tiles (~3 meters, 10 feet) of falling the Damage you received is increased by 1d6 +1. The maximum damage is 10d6 +10 at a falling distance of 20 tiles. You can roll an Athletics check, similar to Dodging , to treat the fall 2 tiles less. For every Extra you can treat the fall 2 tiles less. An armor\u2019s Physical DR does not block this kind of damage. Jumping out a moving vehicle \u00b6 Jumping out a moving vehicle is similar to falling. Per 10 km/h or 6 mp/h you are considered to fall 2 tiles. Terminal velocity \u00b6 Sometimes the damage can be less, if for example the gravity is lower than Earth\u2019s gravity. Othertimes, falling long enough distances can kill you outright. Heat \u00b6 All temperatures above 32\u00b0C (90\u00b0F) are considered severe heat. With enough water, you don\u2019t have to roll to avoid a fatigue point. Without enough water, you have to roll a Body check every four hours. Each 4 Fire DR adds +2 bonus to the check. Recovery A chaaracter receiving enough water recovers from one fatigue point every hour. Incapacitation After a day of incapacitation, the character dies of dehydration. Hunger & Thirst \u00b6 A character requires 1 Ration each day. Every day where a character doesn\u2019t eat requires you to make a Body check. Per missed meal, starting from the first, you suffer a -2 penalty on the roll. On a failed check you suffer a fatigue point. Recovery One meal per day recovers one fatigue point. Food can be administered to incapacitated characters by others. Incapacitation A day after being incapacitated the character dies. Poison \u00b6 Depending on the poison a fatigue point has different outcomes. The poison also states the Attribute used for the checks, the frequency of rolling on the Attribute , the modifiers for each roll, and how it can be treated. Radiation \u00b6 Radiation poisoning is a special kind of Disease . Sleep \u00b6 A (human) character requires at least 6 hours of sleep each day. Every day where a character doesn\u2019t sleep requires you to make a Body check. For each missed sleep, starting from the first, you suffer a -2 penalty on the roll. On a failed check you suffer a fatigue point. Any stimulant adds a +2 to the check. Recovery Getting at least 6 hours of sleep recovers one fatigue point. Incapacitation Each hour the character has to make a Soul check. On a failed check, the character falls asleep for 2d6 hours.","title":"Environment"},{"location":"environment/#environment","text":"","title":"Environment"},{"location":"environment/#fatigue","text":"An hazard can either cause your character to receive a fatigue point, or directly deals damage to him.

[GM Tip] Special Skills In some settings you might want to add special Skills , for example Occultism ( Knowledge Skill) in a Lovecraftian horror story. Such Skills shouldn\u2019t be improvable with Skill Points, but rather by exploring and unveiling secrets. Stats \u00b6 Health (HP) \u00b6 Health abstracts how much wounds a character can take before being incapacitated or dead. For the Body Attribute you roll your die and add it to the Base value. As with any die, the Body die can explode as well. If your Body Attribute is improved by a level-up, you roll your new die and add it to your Health . See Wounds and Healing for more details. Health 20 + Body \u00b1 Circumstance Pace (PACE) \u00b6 The Pace gives you an estimate how quickly you can go from A to B. The Pace is used to determine how far the creature gets by using the Move Action. You can use up your Body die\u2019s sides halfed in meters. The Pace can be lowered by Conditions and Overburdening due to too much Bulk . If your Pace drops to 0, your character is immobilized. Pace Body / 2 + Circumstance Pace A character with a d8 in Body has a Pace of 4. Parry \u00b6 Parry is used to defend against incoming melee attacks. Per additional enemy within melee range you suffer a -1 penalty. If you don\u2019t have a melee weapon equipped, you suffer a -2 penalty. The value for Parry cannot drop below 2. Parry Melee - 1 per additional enemy \u00b1 Circumstance Perception (PER) \u00b6 Perception measures your character\u2019s ability to detect hidden stuff without looking for it actively. Every Stealth roll is opposed by Perception . Per ally near you, that\u2019s able to detect, you receive a +1 bonus to your Perception . Perception Mind / 2 + 1 per ally \u00b1 Circumstance Level (LVL) \u00b6 The Level of a character abstracts his experience, resourcefulness, and skill set. Experience (XP) \u00b6 Experience Points (XP) are gained throughout a character\u2019s adventuring career. XP are gained when resolving a Crisis, due to noteable achievements, or by story completions. Every character starts at Level 1. For a Level-Up you need XP. The higher the Level, the higher the XP requirement. XP and Level Ups 100 * LVL = Level Up XP and Level Ups The XP requirement for Level 2 is 100 XP. The XP requirement for Level 3 is 200. So for Level 3 you require 300 XP in total. Acquisitions \u00b6 A character\u2019s Level improves the maximum values of his Acquisitions . This does not necessarily make the character stronger, but makes the character more resourceful and adaptable. Attribute Points \u00b6 Every 3 levels (Level 3, 6, 9, 12, and so on), a character gains an Attribute Point that can be assigned to Body , Mind , or Soul . Skill Points \u00b6 Every level, a character receives 3 Skill Points. Acquisitions \u00b6 Acquisitions abstract the resources available to a character. Acquisitions are limited by a maximum value, and are used to improve your character. This maximum value is modified by Circumstances, Talents , and permanently due to the character\u2019s Level. The current value for Acquisitions can never exceed the maximum value. All exceeding points are usually lost. Loot Loot abstracts the items and clutter looted, which can be sold for a profit. Spare Time Spare Time is used for Spare Time Rolls. Each Spare Time Roll requires one Spare Time Point. Influence Influence is used to acquire and maintain vessels. Influence can also be used for social encounters. You can spend Influence on favors or on meetings with important people. Resources Resources are used to acquire and maintain equipment. Technology Technology is used to unlock equipment for personal use and vessels. It can also be used to develop vaccines, gun-powder weapons etc. Loot (LOOT) \u00b6 Loot abstracts the items and clutter looted, that can be sold for profit. Gained by looting enemies, bases, etc., trading or via quest rewards. Used to sell for a profit. Loot is usually stored on a vessel or a player base. 1 unit of Loot takes up 4 Bulk . Spare Time (ST) \u00b6 Spare Time represents the time a character can invest in activities outside of active play, e.g. in between sessions. Gained over the course of time. A character gains more ST in between adventures and longer periods of downtime during adventures. A character gains at least 1 ST each session automatically. Used to recuperate, craft, repair and upgrade items and vessels and to improve a character. Depending on the task, a ST roll is made with the associated Skill . As with Skills , you can add applicable modifiers to the roll, e.g. assets or circumstance modifiers. The ST influences the difficulty of the Skill check, and provides a bonus or penalty. An ST rolls is specified by the following scheme: XtY (Skill) , e.g. 2t4 or t6 . X represents the number of successful rolls necessary. The X also represents the ST cost. Y represents the Difficulty Level for each roll. Skill indicates the Skill that has to be used for the ST roll. If a ST roll fails, the ST point is lost. If multiple ST rolls are necessary for a certain task and one of the check fails, there are multiple outcomes: you can continue it at a later time or spend more ST points immediatly, the ST task fails, or the ST task does not have the intended outcome. Maximum Spare Time 10 Spare Time rolls Finding a very rare item on the black market might be represented as a 2t4 Spare Time roll. A character attempts the roll. He needs to spend 2 Spare Time points, and roll the Commerce Skill twice. The roll\u2019s difficulty is a 4 ; Each roll has to be equal to or higher than this difficulty. Influence (INF) \u00b6 Influence represents connections, owed favours by others, fame and infamy. Gained by making a name for yourself in the cosmos, i.e. by helping people and factions. INF is lost by harming and disappointing others (Infamy might also gain you INF based on your reputation). Used for accessing and buying items, unlocking Perks , vessels, meetings with high ranking characters, etc. More INF unlocks better equipment, perks and better vessels. Maximum Influence 2 + LVL \u00b1 Circumstance Resources (RES) \u00b6 Resources (RES) represent materials used for creating, repairing, upgrading and acquiring equipment. Gained by looting, or completing missions, adventures and quests. Used to create, repair, upgrade and acquire equipment and vessels. RES can also be used to repair vessels. Depending on the damage that\u2019s to be repaired, the character, or group, has to accumalate enough RES to repair the vessel. The RES aren\u2019t lost when repairing. If RES are spent on equipment, your maximum RES are temporarily lowered by that amount. This abstracts the upkeep and maintenance of a powerful item. Maximum Resources 2 + LVL \u00b1 Circumstance Technology (TECH) \u00b6 Technology represents the character\u2019s technological knowledge, which on the other hand allows to unlock new Equipment . Gained by aiding science missions, acquiring blueprints, spending spare time on researching certain scientific fields, etc. Used for unlocking experimental equipment and vessels. Once unlocked, the experimental equipment or vessel can be acquired. Certain upgrades require TECH in order to be unlocked. Upgrades have to be unlocked only once, and can be shared and accumalated between characters. Using TECH permanently lowers this value. Maximum Technology 2 + LVL \u00b1 Circumstance Living standard \u00b6 A living standard abstracts and simplifies the micro-management for standard-type campaigns. Every character has a normal living standard by default. This living standard includes normal accomadations, free food and drinks in populated areas, moving in local traffic and areas, etc. This means you don\u2019t have to pay for normal lodging, etc. [GM Tip] - Living standards and survival campaigns If surviving becomes the focus of a session, you can always overrules this and require your players to manage food, drinks and other resources they might need to survive, e.g. wood in a cold setting. Languages \u00b6 Every character has one native language, that\u2019s at step normal . Improving a language also counts towards the skill bonus for the Knowledge category. Learning a Language can be done in three steps. Each step requires you to make a Spare Time roll. Learning the basics of a language requires you to have access to people speaking the language, books and texts written in the language, or other means to learn the language. Basic \u00b6 You are able to communicate on a basic level. Others might not always understand you, but in general they know what you\u2019re trying to tell them. Additionally you can\u2019t read or write in this language. Cost t5 (Linguistics) Normal \u00b6 You have a normal knowledge about the language. You can decipher most texts, and know a good fraction of the language\u2019s vocabulary. Cost t6 (Linguistics) Master \u00b6 You are able to have the most sophisticated conversations with others, and decipher every text, even older dialects that might not be around anymore. Cost 2t6 (Linguistics) Learning languages at character creation \u00b6 If a character chooses to upgrade the Linguistics Skill, he also improves one of his languages to the next step, or learns a new on at Basic level. Upgrading to Master level requires two Linguistics upgrades however.","title":"Character"},{"location":"character/#character","text":"Every player character, non-player character (NPC) and creature such as animals, monsters or even robots, etc. fall under this category and are created using the following rules.","title":"Character"},{"location":"character/#race","text":"The race changes some aspects, including inherent abilities, Attributes , Skills , roleplaying circumstances and more.

[GM Tip] Acquiring perks While perks state their requirements and costs, you as a GM can require additional things before a character can obtain a perk, i.e.: find someone who can train you, make acquiantances with important NPCs, use Skills related to the perk, etc. Also, if the perk is not reasonable for a character at all, the perk simply isn\u2019t available.","title":"Perks"},{"location":"character/perks/#requirements","text":"Perks are restricted by Attributes , Skills , or other stats.

Anything your character does is a Task. A Task implies a die roll: it\u2019s subject to chance and its outcome is uncertain. Skill Ranks \u00b6 Every Skill has either a d4 , d6 , d8 , d10 , or d12 assigned to it. Every Skill has an initial value of a d4 . Skill Rolls \u00b6 Tasks require a Skill check. Every check is done with a die roll. If the roll is equal to or higher than the Difficulty Level \u2014 4 by default\u2014the task succeeds. Otherwise, it fails. After you roll add all modifiers to your die roll and tell the GM your result. The GM tells you if you succeeded or failed. Extras \u00b6 Combat only After a successful roll, divide the final roll by 4 and subtract 1 . This is the amount of Extras you get for the check. An Extra improves certain values, e.g. the damage you deal after a successful Attack. The Extras cannot be lower than 0. Skill Extras Extras = Roll / 4 - 1 Extras A character makes a Light Weapon check to Attack someone. His Skill is a d6 . For the check he rolls 9 in total. 9 divided by 4 minus 1 results in 1 Extra. Skill Modifiers \u00b6 Any modifier can influence the final roll for a Skill . For example, bad weather gives you a -1 penalty, or having the right tool at hand might give you a +1 bonus. Modifiers make it harder or easier for a Task to succeed. Skill Dice \u00b6 Under some circumstances, a die can be modified beyond a d12 or below a d4 . If it\u2019s increased beyond a d12 , you gain a +1 bonus on all checks. If a d4 is decreased, you cannot use the Skill anymore but for very basic tasks. Skill Familiarization \u00b6 Most Skills are very vaguely described and not very specific to simplify character creation and gameplay. Sometimes you might want to emphasize however, that a Skill is dramatically different than how the character would normale use it. In this case, the Skill roll should suffer a -2 penalty. For exceptional knowledge about a certain topic, the GM may provide a +2 bonus to the roll. Skill Contests \u00b6 Whenever two or more opponents pit against each other, e.g. rolling Stealth versus Perception , they enter a Skill Contest. In a Contest the opponents roll on their respective Skills . The higher roll wins the contest. On a tie, the active party wins. Improving A Skill \u00b6 Raising a Skill by 1, e.g. from untrained to a d4 , or from a d4 to a d6 costs 1 Skill Point. You cannot raise the Skill above a d12 , nor decrease a Skill . Increasing a Skill higher than its associated Attribute costs 2 Skill Points instead. Aiding Others \u00b6 Supporting another character requires you to roll the same Skill check, but with a Difficulty Level of 4. A successful check adds a +2 bonus to the supported character\u2019s Skill check. There can be multiple supporters to increase the chance of someone succeeding on the Skill check, but the bonus doesn\u2019t stack. Supporters can critically fail on their Skill check. Each critical fail imposes a -2 penalty to the supported character\u2019s Skill check. Skill Categories \u00b6 Each Skill is associated to an Attribute . Available Skills Like any other RPG system, Q* provides the GM and players with a set of Skills . Neither the system nor characters are limited to these Skills : if you require different Skills to suite your needs, then add them to your game. Action \u00b6 This category contains all Skills that rely on might, speed, and have some sort of physical interaction like running, swimming, climbing, shooting, swinging a sword, etc. Athletics \u00b6 is used for climbing, jumping, running, swimming, dodging, dodging away from falling debris, etc. With this Skill being untrained , the character cannot swim. Climbing Modifier Example -2 Sparce or only thin handholds. -2 Surface is slippery Force \u00b6 is used for breaching doors, break down treasure chests, holding doors shut etc. Heavy Weapons \u00b6 is used when using heavy weapons such as rocket launchers, vehicle mounted machine guns, or firing any vessel\u2019s weapons. Light Weapons \u00b6 is used for ranged weapon attacks with weapons like bows, pistols, lasguns, etc. Lockpick \u00b6 is used to lockpick, break open vaults, break the combination to a safe, etc. Melee \u00b6 is used when using melee weapons or parrying a melee attack. Operate \u00b6 is used for driving, piloting or steering a vessel and remote controlling drones. Specify which type of vessel your want to operate. Stealth \u00b6 is used to hide from others, sneak around, lockpicking, etc. It\u2019s opposed by the Search Skill . Modifier Example +2 Crawling -2 Running +1 Dim Light +2 Darkness +4 Pitch Darkness +2 Light Cover +4 Heavy Cover Knowledge \u00b6 This category contains all Skills that rely on education and intelligence, like science, engineering, etc. Engineering \u00b6 is used for repairing mechanical or electronical motors, operate advanced machinery, etc. Explosives \u00b6 is used to handle and craft explosives, disarm mines, etc. Linguistics \u00b6 is used to decipher scripts, forge documents, etc. Medicine \u00b6 is used to determine the cause of a wound, provide insights on diseases and sicknesses, Healing wounds, etc. Politics \u00b6 is used for insights in politics, history and behaviours of nations, peoples, cities, gangs, groups, etc. Science \u00b6 is used for Anatomy, Biology, Chemistry, Computer, etc. checks. Search \u00b6 is used to actively search for hidden things.

This Skill is opposed by Empathy . Command \u00b6 is used to command crews, give orders on a vessel, lead others, etc. Commerce \u00b6 covers appraising goods, bartering, haggling, etc. It\u2019s often used for Spare Time rolls when acquiring rare items. Empathy \u00b6 is used to determine if somebody is sad, lying, nervous, etc. It opposes Bluffing . Intimidate \u00b6 is used to strike fear into somebody to get information, help, etc. Perform \u00b6 is used to act, dance, sing, etc. Persuade \u00b6 is used to sweaten the deal for somebody to get information, help, etc. Tactics \u00b6 is used to non-verbally communicate with party members in combat, tactically breach into buildings or rooms, etc. Intimidate and Persuade The outcome of Intimidate and Persuade are often the same, but some people are easier to intimidate than to persuade, and vice versa.","title":"Skills"},{"location":"character/skills/#skills","text":"Skills abstract your character\u2019s education, hobbies and fields of expertise.

In a crisis time slows down and actions become more atomic. Difficulty \u00b6 Every task usually has a difficulty of 4 . Sometimes, the GM may want to emphasize however, that a Task is a lot harder or easier than usually and adjust this value. Not all tasks require a check. For example, finding some information inside books can be done without a skill check given enough time. A skill check could be used to reduce the time spent searching, or it could unearth additional information that might be helpful. Difficulty Level Name Description 0 Trivial Everyday tasks. 1 Routine Tasks you do every few days, which can be done by almost everyone. 2 Simple Most people can do this without much effort. 3 Easy Even untrained people still can do these tasks sometimes. 4 Normal You need at least some training to complete these kind of tasks. 5 Demanding You either need gear or good training for these tasks. 8 Challenging You need a lot of training and good gear. 12 Hard You need to be a specialist for these tasks. 16 Very Hard You require help from others to achieve this. 20 Impossible A once in a lifetime achievement. Difficulty This is only a guideline about the difficulty level of certain tasks. Difficulty Modifier \u00b6 Certain circumstances modify the task\u2019s difficulty positively or negatively. Multiple modifiers stack. Modifier Name Description +1 Asset Having the correct tools at hand. -1 Unfavorable Circumstance E.g. climbing a cliff while it\u2019s raining. Stacking Modifiers Even though modifiers stack, multiple assets of the same type do not stack, e.g. two climber\u2019s gears. Turns \u00b6 Each character and creature in a crisis have one turn per round. The order in which they can act is determined by their turn order. Once every character has acted, a new round begins. Turn Order \u00b6 Every character involved in a crisis has to roll for initiative. The character with the highest roll acts first. If two or more player characters have rolled the same result the PCs can agree upon who acts first. If they cannot find an agreement, roll again. The characters retain their original roll, but the conflict is resolved. If a player character and an NPC tie, the player character acts first. Turn Order Mind \u00b1 Circumstance [GM Tip] - NPC Turn Order As a GM you can roll once for a group of NPCs, e.g. a pack of wolves. This simplifies the overhead you have in combat with multiple NPCs. Surprise Round \u00b6 If you attack an enemy who has not noticed you and is not combat ready, you gain an additional turn before actual combat starts. Action Points \u00b6 Every Action in a Crisis requires Action Points (AP). Every character has a minimum of 0 AP and a maximum of 6 AP . At the start of each turn, including the beginning of a Crisis, the character recovers 4 AP . Any AP over 6 are lost, while Actions that require more than the remaining AP are disabled until enough AP are accumulated. An action always costs at least 1 AP , unless an action specifically says otherwise. Actions in parallel Not all Actions require your utmost attention. E.g. while reloading you can still give short commands to e.g. other party members. This is up to the GM however. Attacks \u00b6 An Attack roll is a Skill roll, using the weapon\u2019s associated Skill and stats. Making an Attack Skill \u00b1 HIT \u00b1 Circumstance RoF \u00b6 Using a weapon with a higher RoF allows you to make multiple Attacks against the same or even different targets. An RoF higher than 1 allows you to make optional, consecutive Attack rolls for the same or even different targets at the expense of 1 AP , and a cumulative -2 penalty on HIT , per extra Attack, unless otherwise noted by the weapon. You have to assign all Attacks to your targets first before you roll for them. Using a higher RoF also uses up more bullets ( CAP ). Ranged Attacks \u00b6 A ranged Attack roll is usually made with the Light Weapon Skill , and suffers penalties from RNG . The Difficulty Level to hit is a 4 . Melee Attacks \u00b6 A Melee Attack roll is made with the Melee Skill . The Difficulty Level to hit is the target\u2019s Parry value. Area of Effect \u00b6 Thrown weapons, e.g. grenades, require you to make an Athletics check. The roll otherwise is a normal Ranged Attack with a Difficulty Level of 4 . An Area of Effect weapon does not receive extra damage from Extras . If you miss an Area of Effect Attack, roll a d8 . The result of the d8 determines in which direction you missed. A 1 is being straight back at you, 5 away from you, and 2 through 8 counting clockwise around the target. You miss by a number of squares equal to the range increment of the throw. Missing an AoE Attack and Hex Grids With hexagonal grids you only have 6 adjacent fields. Use a d6 instead, and adjust the numbers accordingly. Dodging \u00b6 Dodging is a Contest between two opponents, whereas the dodger rolls an Athletics check and the attacker his respective weapon\u2019s Skill . Only Area of Effect Attacks can be dodged. Once per round you can try to dodge an incoming Area of Effect Attack. You have to choose to dodge before the attacker rolls his attack. Dodging is an Athletics roll. If you win the contest you can move your character by 1 tile into any direction away from the AoE effect before you receive any damage or effect from it. Cover \u00b6 Cover provides penalties to the attacker for melee and ranged combat. Cover is always relative to other targets. A character can be in total cover for an enemy, but in plain sight for another. Cover provides a penalty for opponents. All rolls and Skill checks that rely on vision, such as attacking, suffer a penalty. Modifier Condition -2 Cover -4 Heavy Cover unhittable Total Cover Positions and Cover Being prone and facing an enemy straight on counts as being in heavy cover (only head and shoulders visible). Cover and firearms When hiding behind materials that are penetrable by bullets, or other projectiles, decrease your Cover by one step. E.g. total cover becomes heavy cover; while in light cover you count as not being behind cover at all. Damage \u00b6 If an Attack is successful, damage can be dealt to the target. You deal your used weapon\u2019s damage, but receive extra damage from the Attack roll. The amount of Extras on the attack roll is the amount of extra damage you deal. If your damage would be reduced to 0 or lower because of defenses, such as damage reduction or dodging, you still deal 1 non-lethal damage to the target. Status Effects are not applied in this case. Dealing Damage Extras + DMG \u00b1 Circumstance Attacking and Damaging A character makes a Ranged Attack. His roll results in a 13. This nets him 2 Extras. Whatever weapon the attacker uses, he gains 2 extra damage. Damage Reduction \u00b6 If a target wears Armor, all damage you deal is reduced by the target\u2019s DR. Damage that\u2019s reduced by the Armor is dealt to the Armor\u2019s Durability instead. If the Armor\u2019s Durability reaches 0, it does not provide DR anymore. Some weapons and Actions circumvent the Armor\u2019s damage reduction, e.g. Armor-Piercing Ammunition. Damage Reduction A target wears an armor with a physical DR of 3, and a durability of 10. He receives 5 physical damage. The armor blocks 3 of the 5 incoming damage. The durability of armor is reduced to 7, and the target only receives 2 points of damage. Non-lethal damage \u00b6 Non-lethal damage is separate pool. If the non-lethal damage is higher than the target\u2019s current Health , the character becomes incapacitated. Wounds \u00b6 Every point of damage you receive deals a wound. A wound can either be lethal or non-lethal. Lethal \u00b6 When a target would die from a lethal Attack, the attacker can decide whether or not to apply non-lethal force, knocking the target unconcious instead of killing it. If a creature\u2019s Health drops to 0 , the creature is incapacitated and Dying . If the Health drops to -10 , the creature immediately dies. Attacks that deal more than 12 wounds in one hit also incapacitate the target. Healing \u00b6 The Medicine Skill can be used to treat wounds suffered within the last hour. Wounds that are older than one hour have to heal naturally. Healing A Character \u00b6 A healer can aid a character\u2019s natural healing progress. A wounded character trying to heal his own wounds suffers a -2 penalty for treating himself. Without any healing aids, such as bandages etc., the healer suffers a -2 penalty to his roll. Having the right tools at hand via an Asset, the penalty is reduced to 0, rather than a +1 bonus. Multiple Assets can provide a bonus instead. If the Medicine check was successful, the patient recovers from 1 wound, and an additional wound for each Extra . Healing A Dying Character \u00b6 If a healer was successful on his Medicine check for his patient, the patient is not dying anymore, but stays incapacitated for the next 10 rounds. Healing Non-Lethal Damage \u00b6 Non-lethal damage can be healed like lethal damage, but it\u2019s twice as effective, meaning a succesful Medicine check heals 2 non-lethal wounds, and each Extra also heals 2 non-lethal damage. Natural Healing \u00b6 Every hour a non-lethal wound is healed automatically. Every day a wounded or incapacitated character has to attempt a Body roll to heal 1 wound naturally. A critical failure on the Body roll causes an additional wound. On a failed check nothing happens. The difficulty of Natural Healing is influenced by these conditions: Modifier Condition -2 Rough traveling -2 No medical attention -2 Poor environmental conditions, such as intense cold, heat, or rain \u2014 Medical attention from self +1 Medical attention from a doctor +2 Medical attention from a doctor in good condition, such as a hospital","title":"Crisis"},{"location":"crisis/#crisis","text":"A crisis requires a character to make some sort of a Skill roll.

Weapon Asset Every Weapon can count as an Asset when trying to intimidate somebody with the Intimidate Skill . Primary & Secondary Weapons \u00b6 You can only have one primary and secondary weapon, but unlimited tertiary weapons. You have to designate one weapon as the primary weapon, and a different one as secondary weapon. You can change this anytime, but not within a Crisis . Primary and secondary weapons are influenced by Equipment Traits such as the Chest Rig , while all other weapons aren\u2019t. Weapon Stats \u00b6 HIT \u00b6 indicates the bonus or penalty the Attack Skill roll receives. DMG \u00b6 indicates the damage this weapon deals. AoE (AoE DMG) \u00b6 indicates how big the radius is in tiles around the center of the Area of Effect, and how high the damage is in the center of the AoE. Creatures within the radius are effected by the AoE, while creatures outside are uneffected. RNG \u00b6 indicates the weapons range increment. Each increment imposes a cumulative -1 penalty to the attack. RNG times 10 is the maximum effective range of the weapon. Any target within the weapons first range increment does not impose a penalty. RoF \u00b6 indicates the weapons rate of fire. See RoF . MAG \u00b6 indicates the number of magazines. A long rest refills the amount of magazines you have. MAG can also be refilled with LOOT . CAP \u00b6 indicates the amount of uses per magazine. The weapon has to be reloaded if the current capacity reaches zero. REL \u00b6 indicates how much AP it takes to reload the weapon. [GM Tip] - Realistic Magazines When a weapon is reloaded any remaining bullets in the current magazine are lost, unless the magazine is purposely kept and its bullet retrieved. This should only be doable outside of combat, or when in combat and outside of immediate danger. [GM Tip] - MAG refilling If your setting requires it, you can overrule the MAG refilling rule. Buying one MAG should cost one-hundreth of the weapon\u2019s Cost. Weapon Tags \u00b6 A weapon can have one or more of the following tags. Burst \u00b6 Weapons with the Burst Tag can only fire a single bullet or a number of bullets equal to its RoF . You can add and deal the damage for all Attacks that hit as if they were a single Attack. Close range \u00b6 Close range weapons deal double their weapon damage when Attacking targets within the first range increment. Long range \u00b6 If you make an Attack with an RoF of 1 you deal a single die more damage. A weapon with 2d6 damage would deal 3d6 instead when using an RoF of 1 . Explosive \u00b6 An explosive weapon deals more damage, the closer the target is to the center of the AoE . At the center, an explosive weapon deals all its dice as damage. Per tile away from the center, the weapon deals one die less, to a minimum of a single die of its damage. For example, a Grenade deals 3d8 damage at the center. 2d8 next to the center, and 1d8 when the target is two tiles away. Three tiles away the grenade doesn\u2019t deal any damage anymore.
