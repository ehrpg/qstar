Furthermore you will need a pencil, eraser, and\nsome paper. To play you also need a few six sided dice (d6) and ten sided\ndice (d10).\n\n\nMechanics\n\n\nAbilities\n\n\nEach character, NPC or even monster is defined by four abilities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMight\n (MI) represents the character\ns physical strength and resilience.\n  Endurance and health are derived from might. Your melee weapon damage\n  also derives from might.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeed\n (SP) measures the character\ns reflexes and hand-eye coordination.\n  It is used for subversive actions (such as sneaking, or lock picking) and\n  is used to better hit with melee weapons and ranged weapons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntelligence\n (IN) describes how well your character learns new things,\n  and how well he remembers already existing things.

It is mostly used in social\n  interactions between characters and NPCs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbilities have ranks going from 1 to 10. Five (5) is the average, conferring\nneither a benefit nor a drawback. Every point below or above five grants an\nadditional benefit. This benefit is called ability modifier:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbility\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n7\n\n\n8\n\n\n9\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModifier\n\n\n-5\n\n\n-4\n\n\n-3\n\n\n-2\n\n\n-1\n\n\n+0\n\n\n+1\n\n\n+2\n\n\n+3\n\n\n+4\n\n\n+5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndurance\n\n\nEndurance\n represents the character\ns short time well being and\nconstitution. A character that reaches zero endurance is knocked\nunconscious. Endurance is determined by rolling a number of dice equal to\nyour \nMight\n rank and then adding the base endurance pool of your race to\nthe results. Which dice is rolled is also determined by the race. Endurance\nrecovers once the character has had enough time to rest (usually resting eight\nhours) without interruptions.  Whenever you permanently increase or decrease\n\nMight\n you must roll the endurance dice and add or subtract that value from\nyour endurance pool.\n\n\nHealth\n\n\nHealth\n represents the overall long-term physical health and well being of\na character. Severe wounds, illness and temporary handicaps (such as broken\narms or legs) are abstracted away in the health pool. If health reaches zero\nthe character dies. Health is determined by rolling a number of dice equal to\nyour \nMight\n rank and then adding the base health pool of your race to the\nresults. Which dice is rolled is also determined by race. Health cannot\nrecovered by resting, and requires external methods (medicine, first aid etc.)\nto recover. Whenever you permanently increase or decrease \nMight\n you must\nroll the health dice and add or subtract that value from your health pool.\n\n\nDamage\n\n\nNormal damage always targets endurance. If endurance drops to zero the\ncharacter becomes incapacitated. \nCritical damage\n is dealt to health\ninstead. If endurance is zero, all damage is dealt to health instead.\n\n\nDamaging objects is the same as damaging another player or NPC, except that\ninanimate objects have no endurance, just health.\n\n\nCritical Hit and Damage\n\n\nCausing a critical hit requires another success in addition to the\nattack roll (see \nMultiple Successes\n down below). If the attack roll\nand the roll to convert to a critical hit are successful, then the\ndamage is converted to \ncritical damage\n and targets the \nHealth\n\npool instead of the \nEndurance\n pool.\n\n\nSkills\n\n\nSkills are areas of expertise a character may acquire throughout the\ncourse of gameplay. Whenever a character attempts a task a skill roll\nis involved.  A skill has five ranks: \nuntrained\n, \nproficient\n,\n\ntrained\n, \nexperienced\n, \nmaster\n. The ranks are numbered 1\n(untrained) through 5 (master) respectively. The rank number denotes\nhow many ten sided dice (d10) you may roll when performing a skill check.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\nDice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntrained\n\n\n1d10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProficient\n\n\n2d10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrained\n\n\n3d10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperienced\n\n\n4d10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster\n\n\n5d10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach skill is associated with an attribute. Ability modifiers are used\nfrom the corresponding associated skill. Every character starts with\nevery skill at the untrained level.\n\n\nTasks\n\n\nOften characters perform tasks such as repairing, shooting or flying a\nspace craft. It is the game masters job to come up with a difficulty\ncheck (\nDC\n) between one and ten. A DC of one (1) is so easy that no\nroll has to be performed, five (5) denotes an averagely difficult\ntask, and ten (10) denotes a task almost impossible to complete. To\nsucceed at a task a player may roll all his dice available to him from\nthe corresponding skill. At least one dice has to meet or exceed the\nDC for the task to completed successfully.  A dice that meets or\nexceeds the DC is called a \nsuccess\n, and dice that do not meet the\nDC are called \nfailures\n.\n\n\nAiding\n\n\nAt the game master\ns discretion, it is possible for one or more\ncharacters to aid another in an upcoming task (henceforth called the\n\nmain task\n). The players aiding must be able to declare, and be able\nto perform the aid before the main task is attempted (i.e. rolled\nfor). Then they must perform the same skill check (consuming an\naction) within their turn. Every success of those aiding translates\ninto a tangible benefit for the main task. Such benefits could include\n(but are not limited to):\n\n\n\n\nOne additional modifier for each success, to be used in the roll of\n  the main task.\n\n\nBetter outcome of the main task, such as less time or materials used.\n\n\nA lowered difficulty for the main task.\n\n\n\n\nThe actual benefits bestowed upon the main task are up to the game\nmaster. Players should state beforehand what they are trying to\nachieve by helping, for example making sure that the player who\nperforms the main task succeeds more easily, or that the task is done\nfaster. This helps the GM to design any potential benefits.\n\n\nGame masters may also demand that a task is not doable alone, for\nexample moving furniture that is too heavy to be moved by just one\ncharacter, or a high enough wall that requires help from another to\nsuccessfully climb.\n\n\nCompetition\n\n\nWhen two characters, or a character and an NPC, pitch their skills against\neach other both roll the respective skill dice. Whoever has the highest roll\n(out of any of the dice) wins. On a tie the participant on the defensive\nside wins. If there is no defensive participant, reroll until a winner is\ndecided. A dice that beats the other side\ns highest roll is called a\n\nsuccess\n, and a dice that does not beat the other side\ns highest roll\nis called a \nfailure\n.\n\n\nMultiple Successes\n\n\nIf a character has more than one die for a specific skill available,\nmore than one action may be attempted at the same time using that\nskill. The DM sets the amount of successes required and adjusts the\nDC accordingly. There is still only one DC for all actions, but now\nthe player has roll multiple successes using the available dice.\n\n\nFor example Mary is a good pilot and thus has 3 dice available and\nan ability modifier of +3. Her ship is under attack, and she wants to\ndeploy counter measures at the right moment, and then make a sharp\nevasive manoeuver. As she has three dice, she may make those two\nactions at the same time. The GM decides on a DC of 6 and Mary rolls:\n4 3 6. She expends two ability modifiers to make the 4 a success and\nthus succeeds at the task.\n\n\nAbility Modifier\n\n\nAbility modifiers are used every time a character makes a roll. If the\nmodifier is negative, then each roll incurs a -1 penalty in order of\nhighest to lowest. Repeat this process until the entire negative\npenalty is spread across the dice rolls.  If the modifier is positive\nthen the player may decide where to spend the ability modifier. The\nplayer may also spread out the positive modifier across multiple\ndice, but may not exceed the total positive modifier available to\nthat ability.\n\n\nExample: Mary has 3 dice for a Melee skill check and a +2 modifier. She\nhas to meet a DC 5 and rolls: 4 2 3. She expends one modifier on the 4\nto make it a success, and uses the other modifier to buy extra damage.\n\n\nAbility modifier may also be expended for other benefits. See the list of\nskills what can be bought by expending an ability modifier.\n\n\nPerks\n\n\nPerks, and flaws, are gained through your race and give your character\nspecial abilities or drawbacks. Perks and flaws aim at making a character\nmore unique. It is up to the game master whether perks can be freely purchased.\nA game master may also give them out based on experience throughout game\nplay, or based on a character\ns background story.\n\n\nImproving your character\n\n\nCharacters are not improved by experience but by spending time and money.\nMoney can buy time at the gym, implants and most importantly training\nlessons for skills.\n\n\nImproving an ability costs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Rank\n\n\nCost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n-512 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n-162 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n-32 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n-2 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n2 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n32 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n162 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n512 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n1 250 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula: \ncost = abs(mod) ^ 4 * 2000\n\n\nImproving a skill costs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Rank\n\n\nCost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntrained\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProficient\n\n\n1 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrained\n\n\n31 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperienced\n\n\n81 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster\n\n\n151 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula: \ncost = ((max(x-1, 0) * 100) ^ 2) - 9000\n\n\nBuying perks may be done at any time, and the perk\ns description lists the\nprice.\n\n\nCrisis\n\n\nWhenever time and order of action is of critical concern a \ncrisis\n starts.\nCombat is always a crisis, but other dangerous situation are also considered\na crisis, such as escaping a space ship that is about to explode. What\nconstitutes a crisis is always up the game master.\n\n\nWhen a crisis starts, all involved roll initiative by rolling a ten\nsided die (d10) and adding their speed modifier to it. Perks and flaws\nmay give additional bonuses or penalties to initiative. Players, NPCs\nand monsters start in the order of the highest initiative to\nlowest. In case of a tie the person with the highest die result wins.\n\n\nActions\n\n\nOnce it is a player\ns turn in a crisis, he or she may do two\nactions. An action takes a small amount of time, and may involve a\nskill check. The game master may decide that a task takes more than\none action, or even takes a couple of rounds. Any number of actions\nmay be converted to \nready actions\n. These are specific conditions\nset by the player that trigger when an external event occurs. If the\ncondition does not occur before his or her next turn, the \nready\naction\n is lost.\n\n\nEverything you do in a crisis as part of an action is almost all of\nthe time solvable through a skill check. Movement in combat is done\nthrough \nAcrobatics\n, hitting an enemy with a sword through\n\nMelee\n or getting a blast door open uses \nHacking\n.\n\n\nFree Actions\n\n\nA game master may also decide that something takes so little time,\nthat it does not count towards the player\ns amount of actions in that\nround. These actions are called \nfree actions\n. For example, the\ngame master may decide that letting go of a ledge takes no time and is\nthus a \nfree action\n.\n\n\nReactions\n\n\nReactions are skill checks that a player or NPC must make upon the\nrequest of the game master. Reactions are triggered by external\nevents, and may happen out of turn for the player. The game master\nsets a DC and a skill, which the player has to succeed or face certain\nconsequences. These reactions do not detract from the player or NPCs\navailable actions on his turn.\n\n\nFor example two players climb a mountain side. One player fails his\nathletics check, slips and falls. The other player may receive a\nreaction to catch him.  Should he fail his friend falls, and if he\nsucceeds he may help is friend to gain footing again.\n\n\nMaking a character\n\n\nFirst: Choose a race\n\n\nQ* supports multiple races, but your game master may restrict them as necessary.\nRaces defines basic attributes, and may grant you perks from the get go. All\nraces are balanced, with some having slight benefits which are weighed out by\ndrawbacks in other areas.\n\n\nSelect a race, and note their starting abilities, perks and flaws on your sheet\nof paper.\n\n\nHuman\n\n\nHumans are the versatile race of Q*, with having no obvious benefits or\ndrawbacks. They are suitable for all kinds of game play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMight\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeed\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntelligence\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharisma\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase Endurance\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase Health\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndurance\n\n\nd10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\nd6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerks\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlaws\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond: Make adaptions\n\n\nThe game master hands out starting money to all players. Use these funds to\npurchase increases in abilities, skills or even perks. If your game master\nallows it, you can take flaws and decrease abilities to increase your starting\nfund. If you decrease an ability you gain as much money as it would have cost\nyou to increase that ability to the old value.\n\n\nYou should increase relevant attributes, and buy ranks in the skills that best\nsuit your character.\n\n\nThird: Roll Endurance and Health\n\n\nUse your race\ns endurance and health dice, and your new ability rank to roll\nendurance and health. Note these values on your character sheet.\n\n\nFourth: Buy equipment\n\n\nLast but not least buy equipment that suits your character. See further down\nbelow on a list of available equipment\n\n\nAvailable Skills\n\n\nThe following skills are available in Q*:\n\n\n\n\nAthletics\n (MI) is used to perform actions such as jumping, climbing,\n  tumbling, lifting, dragging or rope walking. Extra ability modifiers may be\n  spent on completing a task faster, or to avoid extra falling damage in case of\n  controlled jumps. Athletics is also used to move out of harms way. It can be\n  used to dodge hazards such as a falling debris.\n\n\nDriving\n (SP) allows someone to steer land or sea based vehicles, such as\n  cars, motorcycles and tanks.\n\n\nEngineering\n (IN) is used to construct and repair devices, buildings and\n  vehicles. Servicing a motorcycle is considered engineering, as is constructing\n  fortifications or repairing an airlock. Extra ability modifiers can be used\n  to use less materials or complete the action faster.\n\n\nExplosives\n (IN) can be used to disarm, handle or even build explosive\n  ordinance. When explosives are thrown (i.e. grenades) roll Athletics instead.\n  Otherwise defusing and planting explosives is a competition between the one\n  setting it, and the one defusing it.\n\n\nFirst Aid\n (IN) is used to treat wounds and cure health damage. A\n  successful first aid check requires a first aid kit (or similar) and cures\n  an amount of \nHealth\n as defined by the first aid kit. The game master may\n  also limit how often first aid can actually benefit a character depending on\n  the severity of the wounds. Extra ability modifiers can be used to cure extra\n  health damage.\n\n\nHacking\n (IN) is used to bypass electronic security. Its counter skill is\n  also hacking. Extra ability modifiers can be used to get the job done faster.\n\n\nHeavy Weapons\n (SP) allows operations of heavy or stationary guns. Such\n  guns are usually mounted turrets on ships and tanks, but can also be land\n  based artillery or very large man portable weapons such as rocket launchers\n  or guided missile platforms.  Extra ability modifiers can be spend\n  on either extra normal (1 modifier per point) or critical damage (1 modifier\n  per two points).\n\n\nKnowledge\n (IN) is chosen for a particular area, e.g. history, religion,\n  etc. For all other knowledge skills, the character only has basic, common\n  knowledge. \n\n\nLight Weapons\n (SP) is used to operate firearms such as pistols, rifles,\n  or shotguns. Light weapons also applies to man portable weapons such as\n  grenade launchers or light machine guns. Extra ability modifiers can be\n  spent on extra damage. Extra ability modifiers can be spend on either extra\n  normal (1 modifier per point) or critical damage (1 modifier per two points).\n\n\nMelee\n (MI) is the skill involved with all sorts of melee weapons, such as\n  blades, axes, clubs or bare fists and kicks. Extra ability modifiers can be\n  used to purchase extra damage (1 modifier per point) or extra critical damage\n  (1 modifier per two points). It\ns also used for defending against a melee\n  attack, either by deflecting, blocking or dodging an attack.\n\n\nMicro Gravity\n (MI) is the skill that replaces \nAthletics\n in micro\n  gravity environments. It is used to manoeuvre in such weightless conditions.\n\n\nNotice\n (IN) is used to spot hidden things or notice small details that\n  would otherwise be missed. It is the counter part skill to stealth.\n\n\nOratory\n (CA) is used to sway another in ones favour through social\n  interactions. It allows a character to bargain, bluff, intimidate or charm\n  another. The counter skill is called \nSense Motive\n.\n\n\nPiloting\n (SP) is used to pilot any air or space borne vehicle. It\ns also\n  used in vessel combat to attack and defend.\n\n\nScience\n (IN) is chosen for a particular scientific field, e.g. geology,\n  biology, astronomy, medicine, etc. For all other scientific areas that weren\nt\n  chosen, the character has basic knowledge. They only know common knowledge in\n  these areas (according to their education), but nothing special.\n\n\nSense Motive\n (CA) allows to spot bluffs in conversations, spot an resist\n  an intimidation attempt or otherwise realise when ones belly is rubbed with\n  honey. It is the counter part skill to \nOratory\n.\n\n\nStealth\n (SP) is used to sneak about, hide, hide things or use sleight\n  of hand to conceal items. Its counter skill is \nNotice\n.",

Micro Gravity  (MI) is the skill that replaces  Athletics  in micro\n  gravity environments. It is used to manoeuvre in such weightless conditions.  Notice  (IN) is used to spot hidden things or notice small details that\n  would otherwise be missed. It is the counter part skill to stealth.  Oratory  (CA) is used to sway another in ones favour through social\n  interactions. It allows a character to bargain, bluff, intimidate or charm\n  another.

This of course is only a guideline, and the game masters\nmay set the DCs at their discretion. Just be fair, as most players won\nt\ntolerate unfairness for long.\n\n\nDesigning DCs\n\n\nThe easiest way to go about designing DCs is to have a baseline on what\nan average difficult task in said skill would be (so a DC 5) and compare\nfrom there. After you have determined the base DC, you then add or subtract\nexternal influences.\n\n\nSkills\n\n\nAthletics\n\n\nAthletics is a difficult topic. Generally jumping three metres is\nsomething every able bodied human should be capable of doing with a\nrunning head start (DC 3). Adverse conditions (for example wet\nsurfaces, or the need jump over a ledge) should add to the DC of said\njump. Additional metres, or the inability to make a running head start\nshould also increase the DC. Decrease the DC if the target ledge of\nthe jump is below the start ledge, or if there\ns someone on the other\nside to catch the jumper.\n\n\nClimbing relies heavily on external factors, such as the surface,\nweather, and whether climbing gear is available. Long climbs might\nrequire multiple checks, where partial failures might bar a player\nfrom ascending any further. Climbing also heavily benefits from one\nexperienced climber that goes ahead and instructs others.\n\n\nThrowing depends on the weight. For example a 0.3 kg grenade can\nbe thrown 40 metres by the average person while standing still. A\n1 kg object roughly 30 metres. Ranges may increase with a half or\nfull approach.\n\n\nDriving\n\n\nSomeone who has at least some experience in driving should not have to\nroll to drive from point A to point B in normal street conditions.\nDriving skill checks should be made at specific points when required.\nChasing another vehicle, trying to shake a chasing vehicle or driving\nrecklessly in traffic are all conditions were a driving check might be\ncalled for. Difficult off-road driving, driving while being shot at or\noperating unfamiliar vehicles might also call for driving checks.\n\n\nEngineering\n\n\nPlanning an engineering project might always be a low or average DC\nbut might take more time. Generally speaking the more planning goes\ninto an engineering project, the lower the DC should be. Available to\na wide variety of tools (-1), or building materials (-1) should\nprovide bonuses, while the absence of these should make the task\nharder. It depends highly on the project itself, but the material\nshould change the attributes of the final product instead of making\nthe DC harder. While building a house out of wood is equally as\nchallenging as building one out of brick, the wooden house has\ndifferent properties. Reflect these changes in the final product\ninstead of adding to the DC. Of course there are also wrong materials\nfor certain products, for example you would not fix a hull breach of a\nspace ship with wood.\n\n\nHacking\n\n\nHacking, contrary to popular belief, requires a lot of preparation. Usually\nsystems to be hacked are analysed first and might require several hours if\nnot weeks to find a weakness. Systems that have already been broken, and\nhave an exploit written for them, are easier to be hacked and sometimes do\nnot require any expertise at all. Such DCs can be low, and the difficulty\ncould be counter acted by cost. Buying exploits, or even zero day exploits\nis expensive. Finding your own exploits can be a difficult or time consuming\ntask.\n\n\nHeavy Weapons\n\n\nJust like most light weapons (see below) heavy weapons have an effective\nrange that indicate a range and hit probability. But unlike with light\nweapons the weapon specifies what size of target its effective range is\nrated for.\n\n\nLight Weapons\n\n\nAll light weapons (pistols, rifles etc.) have an effective range. This\nrange indicates how many metres away a decently skilled shooter is able\nto hit a man sized target half the time (DC 5). There is also an upper\nlimit in certain areas, as it becomes increasingly difficult to see\nand shoot enemies further away than 400 metres without a scope. Being\nin a firing prone position helps (-1), as does having time to aim with\na supported weapon (-1). Being otherwise prone doesn\nt help (+1), neither\ndoes firing a weapon beyond its effective range (+1). Weather is a huge\nfactor especially at longer ranges. Firing in large volumes (i.e. burst fire)\nshould reduce the DC dramatically as one bullet is bound to hit. Firing\nin full auto rarely helps, unless the gun is recoil controlled (i.e. by\nbeing mounted). Not all shots are meant to hit, many bullets are fired\nto suppress an enemy. Often the target is smaller or larger than a man\nsized target and you should adjust the DC accordingly. Hitting a large\nspace craft is quite realistic, even from longer distances while a very\ntiny object may be impossible to hit.\n\n\nMicro Gravity\n\n\nThis is similar to athletics, and the DC highly depends on the actions\ninvolved. Many tasks are made substantially easier by helpful gear,\nsuch as magnetic boots or even small manoeuvring thrusters. Lifting\nand dragging are no problem in micro gravity. However what can be a\nproblem is reducing the velocity of objects in motion.\n\n\nPiloting\n\n\nJust like driving, flying from one point to another without any\nhindrances should not require a check. Tricky landings or take offs\nmight however require a roll. External influences like strong winds\n(for atmospheric air vehicles), fogs and rain should increase the DCs\n(+1) while strong weather such as storms should increase the DCs a lot\n(+2). The most difficult scenario in space is navigating through a\ndebris or asteroid field with high speed (+3) but may be easier with\nlower velocities (+1). Just like with driving, tasks should get more\ndifficult when the players are rushed or threatened. It is harder to\ndo a difficult turn or manoeuvre while being shot at, or while trying\nto evade a pursuer. The state of the vehicle also adds or removes from\nthe DC, for example a car with a blown out tire is harder to steer.",

            "text": "Vessels\n\n\nType\n\n\nAll vessels are given one more types defining in which environments they operate\nin. The environment can impose penalties to a vessel, or simply disable, damage,\nor destroy it.\n\n\nSpace means that the vessel is capable of manoeuvring in outer space, air means\nthat is also capable of flying through an atmosphere. If a vessel has both space\nand air listed, the vessel is capable of making a transition from atmosphere to\nouter space and vice versa. Land means that the vessel moves on land, and water\nmeans that it moves on or in water.\n\n\nVessel Statistics\n\n\nAttack\n\n\nAny vessel is outfitted with electronics for aim assistance, manoeuvring and so\nforth. Bigger and better vessels have better and more sophisticated electronics\nthan smaller and cheaper vessels. The attack value is a bonus the pilot of a\nsmall vessel or officer of a bigger vessel gains when attacking.\n\n\nDefence\n\n\nShips also have an armour rating. Armour reduces the incoming damage (both\nnormal and critical) by the listed damage reduction amount. Any damage above the\ndamage reduction is passed on to the ships shield hit points or hull integrity.\nThe full damage is subtracted from the hit points of the armour. If the armour\nreaches zero hit points its damage reduction drops to zero and thus stops being\nuseful.\n\n\nA vessel can outfit multiple armour plating. The damage reduction is not\ncumulative, but the armour hit points are, given the armour is of the same type.\nDamage is always subtracted from the armour providing the most damage reduction\nfirst.\n\n\nSpeed\n\n\nSmaller vessels have the upper hand when it comes to manoeuvring. As such, they\ngain a bonus to evading enemy fire, while bigger, slower vessels are penalised.\n\n\nShield Hit Points\n\n\nShields come in great variety to protect a vessel versus any kind of damage.\nF.e. a shield might be a simple sand screen that deflects beam and laser\nweapons. Also, point-defence versus small fighter wings, boarding pods, or\nmissiles add to the shield hit points value. The hit points abstract the\nrecharge speed of shields, or reload speed of point defence.\n\n\nHull Integrity\n\n\nHull Integrity is the Health for vessels, and depends on the size and quality of\nthe vessel. When dropping below the maximum, the vessel begins venting\natmosphere or becomes otherwise impeded, which might be dangerous by itself. If\nthe hull integrity drops below one half of the maximum, the vessel\ns power\nsupply is cut, disabling all functions. If the hull integrity reaches zero, the\nvessel is utterly destroyed in a blast. Certain weapons are designed to drop the\nhull integrity temporarily, so that the vessel can be boarded rather than\ndestroyed. See vessel equipment for details.\n\n\nSize\n\n\nEvery vessel is categorised into small, medium, large, or capital vessels. The\nvessel statistics also provide a single value for its size. The size defines how\nmuch space there is on a vessel for cargo, rooms such as quarters, or even\nspecialised modules like docking bays.\n\n\nVessel Combat\n\n\nAttacking and Defending\n\n\nAttacking and defending follow the competition rules of Q*. The pilot of a\nvessel can make an attack roll using their dice pool of the associated skill.\nBesides any ability modifiers, the attacker also gains or loses the vessels\nattack value. The same rules apply to the defender.\n\n\nExample: An attacker is trained with piloting the vessel, and thus has 3 dice\nfor the check. The character also has a +2 modifier on the associated ability,\nand the vessel has +1 on its attack value, resulting in +3, that can be spent\nacross any of the 3 dice. The defender also rolls on the associated piloting\nskill in which they are trained, has a +1 modifier on the associated ability,\nbut a -1 speed value due to the vessel size. Both attacker and defender can\napply positive modifiers or have to subtract negative ones. The one with the\nhigher result succeeds.\n\n\nSmart Weapons\n\n\nWeapons with guided weapon systems such as missiles or torpedos do not depend on\nthe pilots skills. The statistics for these weapon provide their own \nskill\nrank\n and \nattack value\n. If the vessel has multiple launchers for these\nweapons, follow the \nmultiple weapons\n rules.\n\n\nMultiple Weapons\n\n\nWeapons of the same type can be fired in groups to a maximum of 5. There are two\nkinds of bonuses for having more than 1 weapon, which the attacker can choose\nwhen firing.\n\n\nSpread Fire Mode\n\n\nEvery additional weapon reduces the defender\ns \nspeed value\n by one, until it\nreaches 0. The \nspeed value\n due to multiple weapons can\nt fall below 0.\n\n\nExample: An attacker is firing a battery of 4 rail guns upon a small vessel with\na \nspeed value\n of +2. The attacker has 4 dice and +4 on his attack due to the\npilot\ns skill. Because the attacker has 4 rail guns, they could reduce any\ndefender\ns \nspeed value\n by 3, to a minimum of 0. In this case the defender\ns\n\nspeed value\n is reduced to 0. The attack succeeds, and deals damage.\n\n\nFocused Fire Mode\n\n\nEvery die that exceeds the defender\ns highest roll results in another hit.\n\n\nExample: An attacker is firing a battery of 4 rail guns upon a small vessel with\na \nspeed value\n of +2. The attacker has 4 dice and +4 on his attack due to the\npilots skill. The attacker decides to add additional damage rather than reducing\nthe enemy\ns speed value. Two of his dice, after applying bonuses, exceed the\ndefender\ns defence roll. Instead of dealing damage once, the attacker deals\ndamage twice.\n\n\nDamaging\n\n\nIf the attack succeeds, the attacker can deal damage to the attacked vessel. The\ndamage is reduced by the attacked vessels damage reduction. Any exceeding damage\nis subtracted from the ships shield hit points or hull integrity.\n\n\nExample: The attacking ship fires a missile that would deal 20 points of damage\nto the attacked vessel. The attacked vessel has four armour plates with 10\ndamage reduction and 50 hit points, resulting in a total of 10 damage reduction\nand 200 hit points. The damage of the missile is reduced by 10 by the armours\ndamage reduction, reducing the armour hit points by 20 to a total of 180, and\nthe ships shield hit points or hull integrity by 10.\n\n\nBoarding\n\n\nBoarding only becomes an option once the shield hit points of a vessel are\nreduced to 0.\n\n\nOptional\n\n\nFuel\n\n\nPower",
