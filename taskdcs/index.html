                <p>This document should be a guide for the dungeon master on how to design
DCs for tasks. This of course is only a guideline, and the game masters
may set the DCs at their discretion. Just be fair, as most players won&rsquo;t
tolerate unfairness for long.</p>
<h1 id="designing-dcs">Designing DCs<a class="headerlink" href="#designing-dcs" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The easiest way to go about designing DCs is to have a baseline on what
an average difficult task in said skill would be (so a DC 5) and compare
from there. After you have determined the base DC, you then add or subtract
external influences.</p>
<h1 id="skills">Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<h2 id="athletics">Athletics<a class="headerlink" href="#athletics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Athletics is a difficult topic. Generally jumping three metres is
something every able bodied human should be capable of doing with a
running head start (DC 3). Adverse conditions (for example wet
surfaces, or the need jump over a ledge) should add to the DC of said
jump. Additional metres, or the inability to make a running head start
should also increase the DC. Decrease the DC if the target ledge of
the jump is below the start ledge, or if there&rsquo;s someone on the other
side to catch the jumper.</p>
<p>Climbing relies heavily on external factors, such as the surface,
weather, and whether climbing gear is available. Long climbs might
require multiple checks, where partial failures might bar a player
from ascending any further. Climbing also heavily benefits from one
experienced climber that goes ahead and instructs others.</p>
<p>Throwing depends on the weight. For example a 0.3 kg grenade can
be thrown 40 metres by the average person while standing still. A
1 kg object roughly 30 metres. Ranges may increase with a half or
full approach.</p>
<h2 id="driving">Driving<a class="headerlink" href="#driving" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Someone who has at least some experience in driving should not have to
roll to drive from point A to point B in normal street conditions.
Driving skill checks should be made at specific points when required.
Chasing another vehicle, trying to shake a chasing vehicle or driving
recklessly in traffic are all conditions were a driving check might be
called for. Difficult off-road driving, driving while being shot at or
operating unfamiliar vehicles might also call for driving checks.</p>
<h2 id="engineering">Engineering<a class="headerlink" href="#engineering" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Planning an engineering project might always be a low or average DC
but might take more time. Generally speaking the more planning goes
into an engineering project, the lower the DC should be. Available to
a wide variety of tools (-1), or building materials (-1) should
provide bonuses, while the absence of these should make the task
harder. It depends highly on the project itself, but the material
should change the attributes of the final product instead of making
the DC harder. While building a house out of wood is equally as
challenging as building one out of brick, the wooden house has
different properties. Reflect these changes in the final product
instead of adding to the DC. Of course there are also wrong materials
for certain products, for example you would not fix a hull breach of a
space ship with wood.</p>
<h2 id="hacking">Hacking<a class="headerlink" href="#hacking" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Hacking, contrary to popular belief, requires a lot of preparation. Usually
systems to be hacked are analysed first and might require several hours if
not weeks to find a weakness. Systems that have already been broken, and
have an exploit written for them, are easier to be hacked and sometimes do
not require any expertise at all. Such DCs can be low, and the difficulty
could be counter acted by cost. Buying exploits, or even zero day exploits
is expensive. Finding your own exploits can be a difficult or time consuming
task.</p>
<h2 id="heavy-weapons">Heavy Weapons<a class="headerlink" href="#heavy-weapons" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Just like most light weapons (see below) heavy weapons have an effective
range that indicate a range and hit probability. But unlike with light
weapons the weapon specifies what size of target its effective range is
rated for.</p>
<h2 id="light-weapons">Light Weapons<a class="headerlink" href="#light-weapons" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>All light weapons (pistols, rifles etc.) have an effective range. This
range indicates how many metres away a decently skilled shooter is able
to hit a man sized target half the time (DC 5). There is also an upper
limit in certain areas, as it becomes increasingly difficult to see
and shoot enemies further away than 400 metres without a scope. Being
in a firing prone position helps (-1), as does having time to aim with
a supported weapon (-1). Being otherwise prone doesn&rsquo;t help (+1), neither
does firing a weapon beyond its effective range (+1). Weather is a huge
factor especially at longer ranges. Firing in large volumes (i.e. burst fire)
should reduce the DC dramatically as one bullet is bound to hit. Firing
in full auto rarely helps, unless the gun is recoil controlled (i.e. by
being mounted). Not all shots are meant to hit, many bullets are fired
to suppress an enemy. Often the target is smaller or larger than a man
sized target and you should adjust the DC accordingly. Hitting a large
space craft is quite realistic, even from longer distances while a very
tiny object may be impossible to hit.</p>
<h2 id="micro-gravity">Micro Gravity<a class="headerlink" href="#micro-gravity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This is similar to athletics, and the DC highly depends on the actions
involved. Many tasks are made substantially easier by helpful gear,
such as magnetic boots or even small manoeuvring thrusters. Lifting
and dragging are no problem in micro gravity. However what can be a
problem is reducing the velocity of objects in motion.</p>
<h2 id="piloting">Piloting<a class="headerlink" href="#piloting" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Just like driving, flying from one point to another without any
hindrances should not require a check. Tricky landings or take offs
might however require a roll. External influences like strong winds
(for atmospheric air vehicles), fogs and rain should increase the DCs
(+1) while strong weather such as storms should increase the DCs a lot
(+2). The most difficult scenario in space is navigating through a
debris or asteroid field with high speed (+3) but may be easier with
lower velocities (+1). Just like with driving, tasks should get more
difficult when the players are rushed or threatened. It is harder to
do a difficult turn or manoeuvre while being shot at, or while trying
to evade a pursuer. The state of the vehicle also adds or removes from
the DC, for example a car with a blown out tire is harder to steer.</p>
