## Radiation

*Characters are radiated over time.*

The radiation poisoning of a character is measured by rads. Any value smaller
than one is ignored. All radiation a character receives is rounded down.

The unit for measuring radiation is defined by rad/hour. For simplicity, this
value can be divided by 10, if a character isn't exposed for a full hour. 

Example: A character who is exposed for 5 minutes would suffer one tenth of the
radiation, so 6 minutes worth of exposure. A character who is exposed for 26
minutes would suffer one half of the radiation, so 30 minutes worth of exposure.

Example: A zone is contaminated and heavily radiated. Characters in the zone
receive 500rad/h. A character stays in the zone for 43 minutes. The DM divides
the radiation value by ten, resulting in 50rad/6min. The character receives 48
minutes (eigth tenth) worth of exposure, resulting in 400 rad.

  0-149 very nauseous
150-299 slightly fatigued
300-449 vomiting does not stop
450-599 hair is falling out
600-799 skin is falling off
800-999 intense agony
  1000+ death

## Food & Water

*Characters get hungry and thirsty, and need to eat and drink each day or suffer
the consequences.*

Each character needs **one ration** worth of food and drinks **each day**. For
each day a character does not eat and drink, they lose **10 points** of
**endurance** of their maximum. If the **endurance** becomes zero they fall
unconcious and enter the **starving** state. 

A **starving** character loses **10 points** of **health** of their maximum
health each day until the character dies or receives medical attention.

A character regenerates **10 points** of **health** and **endurance** if they
stay in bed and get **one ration** worth of food and drinks **each day**.
<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>
**Health** points are regained first.

   from others to regain conciousness.</small> [â†©](#a1)
