# Q*

Q* (qstar) is an RPG Pen & Paper System, that tries to streamline and abstract
as much as possible. At the same time, it's highly extensible because the base
rules do not make any assumption about the setting (fantasy, western, scifi) you
want to play.

The rules are kept as simple as possible while providing a certain amount of
realism. For some of the rules, especially equipment, it's highly recommended to
get printouts besides a character sheet.
