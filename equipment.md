# Credits

Prices are listed in credits. Credits are a completely digital currency,
that are stored on credit cards. These cards will store amount of credits
on them, and also a list of transactions. Credits may transferred from
these cards to other cards to make transactions.

# Suits

Suits are full body suits used in hazardous environments (underwater, space,
extreme heat or cold, or on planets with hazardous climate) or for battle.
Suits all have an armour rating. Armour reduces the incoming damage (both
normal and critical) by the listed damage reduction amount. Any damage above
the damage reduction is passed on to the character wearing the suit. The
full damage is subtracted from the hit points of the armour. If the armour
reaches zero hit points its damage reduction drops to zero and thus stops
being useful.

| Suit       |  DR |  HP |   Cost | Extras                                                       |
| ---------- | --: | --: | -----: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| UHAS MK I  |   2 |  40 |  9 000 | Space suit, mag boots, internal radio                        |
| UHAS MK II |   4 |  60 | 15 000 | Space suit, mag boots, internal radio, camera                |
| MACS MK I  |   6 |  50 | 50 000 | Combat armour, space suit, mag boots, radio                  |
| MACS MK II |   8 |  70 | 90 000 | Advanced combat armour, space suit, mag boots, radio, camera |

# Melee Weapons

Melee weapons have a cost and damage. They get the might ability modifier
as extra damage.

| Weapon  | Damage | Cost |
| ------- | -----: | ---: |
| Fists   |      4 |    - |
| Baton   |     10 |  100 |
| Knife   |     14 |  100 |
| Hatchet |     18 |  100 |
| Sword   |     24 |  400 |

# Ranged Weapons

Ranged weapons have a cost, damage and a magazine capacity. Prices for
magazines are listed as well. It is assumed that a person just buys
bullets and reloads the magazines. Magazine capacity lists how often
a fully loaded gun can be fired before it runs out of bullets. Players
are responsible for tracking this information. Notes denote additional
perks the weapons have. An action can be used to aim once, which should
reduce the DC of the next shot.

| Weapon | Damage | Capacity |   Cost | Magazine | Notes                             |
| ------ | -----: | -------: | -----: | -------: | --------------------------------- |
| CP9    |     12 |          |  1 100 |       20 | Single shot, compact, pistol      |
| P32    |     12 |       15 |    900 |       30 | Single shot, Pistol               |
| RX60   |     16 |       30 |  6 200 |      150 | Select fire                       |
| AX7    |     20 |       30 |  9 100 |      400 | Select fire, rifle                |
| M80A2  |     32 |        5 | 12 000 |      600 | Single shot, rifle, high accuracy |
| RPT    |     20 |      100 | 15 000 |      500 | Select fire, rifle                |
| HP3 A1 |     36 |        1 | 22 000 |    1 000 | Single shot, rifle, high accuracy |

* *Compact* means that the weapon can be easily concealed. **Stealth**
  skill checks involved in this weapon should be easier.
* *Pistol* means that the weapon is hand held, and can be carried easily
  on the armour or suit. Most pistols only have good accuracy at shorter
  distances.
* *Rifle* means that the weapon is a full length rifle. Concealing it is
  harder if almost impossible. But the rifle has greater accuracy over
  medium distances.
* *Single shot* means that the weapon can only fire one bullet per skill
  roll. Multiple successes can be used to fire repeatedly at a target
  however.
* *Select fire* means that the weapon is capable of fully automatic fire,
  alongside single shots. Small bursts can be fired in a single skill
  roll which will reduce the DC to hit. Multiple successes can be used to
  fire multiple bursts.
* *High accuracy* means that the weapon is capable of firing accurately
  over longer distances. The DC should be lowered in such cases.

# Medical Items

Some checks and tasks may require one or more of these items to be accessible.
Easier tasks can be done without e.g. tools, but tend to require a lot more
time.
