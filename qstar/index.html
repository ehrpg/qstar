<p>Q* is the working title for a bunch of modifications for the Endless Horizons
Pen &amp; Paper game.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>You will need a game master, someone who is willing to run and guide the game,
and at least two other players. Furthermore you will need a pencil, eraser, and
some paper. To play you also need a few six sided dice (d6) and ten sided
dice (d10).</p>
<h1 id="mechanics">Mechanics<a class="headerlink" href="#mechanics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<h2 id="abilities">Abilities<a class="headerlink" href="#abilities" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Each character, NPC or even monster is defined by four abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Might</strong> (MI) represents the character&rsquo;s physical strength and resilience.
  Endurance and health are derived from might. Your melee weapon damage
  also derives from might.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Speed</strong> (SP) measures the character&rsquo;s reflexes and hand-eye coordination.
  It is used for subversive actions (such as sneaking, or lock picking) and
  is used to better hit with melee weapons and ranged weapons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intelligence</strong> (IN) describes how well your character learns new things,
  and how well he remembers already existing things. It is a key factor in
  skills like hacking, medicine or engineering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Charisma</strong> (CA) represents the character&rsquo;s physical attractiveness, force
  of personality and his ability to lead. It is mostly used in social
  interactions between characters and NPCs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Abilities have ranks going from 1 to 10. Five (5) is the average, conferring
neither a benefit nor a drawback. Every point below or above five grants an
additional benefit. This benefit is called ability modifier:</p>

<h2 id="endurance">Endurance<a class="headerlink" href="#endurance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>Endurance</strong> represents the character&rsquo;s short time well being and
constitution. A character that reaches zero endurance is knocked
unconscious. Endurance is determined by rolling a number of dice equal to
your <strong>Might</strong> rank and then adding the base endurance pool of your race to
the results. Which dice is rolled is also determined by the race. Endurance
recovers once the character has had enough time to rest (usually resting eight
hours) without interruptions.  Whenever you permanently increase or decrease
<strong>Might</strong> you must roll the endurance dice and add or subtract that value from
your endurance pool.</p>
<h2 id="health">Health<a class="headerlink" href="#health" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>Health</strong> represents the overall long-term physical health and well being of
a character. Severe wounds, illness and temporary handicaps (such as broken
arms or legs) are abstracted away in the health pool. If health reaches zero
the character dies. Health is determined by rolling a number of dice equal to
your <strong>Might</strong> rank and then adding the base health pool of your race to the
results. Which dice is rolled is also determined by race. Health cannot
recovered by resting, and requires external methods (medicine, first aid etc.)
to recover. Whenever you permanently increase or decrease <strong>Might</strong> you must
roll the health dice and add or subtract that value from your health pool.</p>
<h2 id="damage">Damage<a class="headerlink" href="#damage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Normal damage always targets endurance. If endurance drops to zero the
character becomes incapacitated. <strong>Critical damage</strong> is dealt to health
instead. If endurance is zero, all damage is dealt to health instead.</p>
<p>Damaging objects is the same as damaging another player or NPC, except that
inanimate objects have no endurance, just health.</p>
<h2 id="critical-hit-and-damage">Critical Hit and Damage<a class="headerlink" href="#critical-hit-and-damage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Causing a critical hit requires another success in addition to the
attack roll (see <strong>Multiple Successes</strong> down below). If the attack roll
and the roll to convert to a critical hit are successful, then the
damage is converted to <strong>critical damage</strong> and targets the <strong>Health</strong>
pool instead of the <strong>Endurance</strong> pool.</p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Skills are areas of expertise a character may acquire throughout the
course of gameplay. Whenever a character attempts a task a skill roll
is involved.  A skill has five ranks: <strong>untrained</strong>, <strong>proficient</strong>,
<strong>trained</strong>, <strong>experienced</strong>, <strong>master</strong>. The ranks are numbered 1
(untrained) through 5 (master) respectively. The rank number denotes
how many ten sided dice (d10) you may roll when performing a skill check.</p>
<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each skill is associated with an attribute. Ability modifiers are used
from the corresponding associated skill. Every character starts with
every skill at the untrained level.</p>
<h2 id="tasks">Tasks<a class="headerlink" href="#tasks" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Often characters perform tasks such as repairing, shooting or flying a
space craft. It is the game masters job to come up with a difficulty
check (<strong>DC</strong>) between one and ten. A DC of one (1) is so easy that no
roll has to be performed, five (5) denotes an averagely difficult
task, and ten (10) denotes a task almost impossible to complete. To
succeed at a task a player may roll all his dice available to him from
the corresponding skill. At least one dice has to meet or exceed the
DC for the task to completed successfully.  A dice that meets or
exceeds the DC is called a <strong>success</strong>, and dice that do not meet the
DC are called <strong>failures</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="aiding">Aiding<a class="headerlink" href="#aiding" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>At the game master&rsquo;s discretion, it is possible for one or more
characters to aid another in an upcoming task (henceforth called the
<em>main task</em>). The players aiding must be able to declare, and be able
to perform the aid before the main task is attempted (i.e. rolled
for). Then they must perform the same skill check (consuming an
action) within their turn. Every success of those aiding translates
into a tangible benefit for the main task. Such benefits could include
(but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>One additional modifier for each success, to be used in the roll of
  the main task.</li>
<li>Better outcome of the main task, such as less time or materials used.</li>
<li>A lowered difficulty for the main task.</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual benefits bestowed upon the main task are up to the game
master. Players should state beforehand what they are trying to
achieve by helping, for example making sure that the player who
performs the main task succeeds more easily, or that the task is done
faster. This helps the GM to design any potential benefits.</p>
<p>Game masters may also demand that a task is not doable alone, for
example moving furniture that is too heavy to be moved by just one
character, or a high enough wall that requires help from another to
successfully climb.</p>
<h2 id="competition">Competition<a class="headerlink" href="#competition" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>When two characters, or a character and an NPC, pitch their skills against
each other both roll the respective skill dice. Whoever has the highest roll
(out of any of the dice) wins. On a tie the participant on the defensive
side wins. If there is no defensive participant, reroll until a winner is
decided. A dice that beats the other side&rsquo;s highest roll is called a
<strong>success</strong>, and a dice that does not beat the other side&rsquo;s highest roll
is called a <strong>failure</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-successes">Multiple Successes<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-successes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If a character has more than one die for a specific skill available,
more than one action may be attempted at the same time using that
skill. The DM sets the amount of successes required and adjusts the
DC accordingly. There is still only one DC for all actions, but now
the player has roll multiple successes using the available dice.</p>
<p>For example Mary is a good pilot and thus has 3 dice available and
an ability modifier of +3. Her ship is under attack, and she wants to
deploy counter measures at the right moment, and then make a sharp
evasive manoeuver. As she has three dice, she may make those two
actions at the same time. The GM decides on a DC of 6 and Mary rolls:
4 3 6. She expends two ability modifiers to make the 4 a success and
thus succeeds at the task.</p>
<h2 id="ability-modifier">Ability Modifier<a class="headerlink" href="#ability-modifier" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Ability modifiers are used every time a character makes a roll. If the
modifier is negative, then each roll incurs a -1 penalty in order of
highest to lowest. Repeat this process until the entire negative
penalty is spread across the dice rolls.  If the modifier is positive
then the player may decide where to spend the ability modifier. The
player may also spread out the positive modifier across multiple
dice, but may not exceed the total positive modifier available to
that ability.</p>
<p>Example: Mary has 3 dice for a Melee skill check and a +2 modifier. She
has to meet a DC 5 and rolls: 4 2 3. She expends one modifier on the 4
to make it a success, and uses the other modifier to buy extra damage.</p>
<p>Ability modifier may also be expended for other benefits. See the list of
skills what can be bought by expending an ability modifier.</p>
<h2 id="perks">Perks<a class="headerlink" href="#perks" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Perks, and flaws, are gained through your race and give your character
special abilities or drawbacks. Perks and flaws aim at making a character
more unique. It is up to the game master whether perks can be freely purchased.
A game master may also give them out based on experience throughout game
play, or based on a character&rsquo;s background story.</p>
<h2 id="improving-your-character">Improving your character<a class="headerlink" href="#improving-your-character" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Characters are not improved by experience but by spending time and money.
Money can buy time at the gym, implants and most importantly training
lessons for skills.</p>

<h2 id="crisis">Crisis<a class="headerlink" href="#crisis" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Whenever time and order of action is of critical concern a <strong>crisis</strong> starts.
Combat is always a crisis, but other dangerous situation are also considered
a crisis, such as escaping a space ship that is about to explode. What
constitutes a crisis is always up the game master.</p>
<p>When a crisis starts, all involved roll initiative by rolling a ten
sided die (d10) and adding their speed modifier to it. Perks and flaws
may give additional bonuses or penalties to initiative. Players, NPCs
and monsters start in the order of the highest initiative to
lowest. In case of a tie the person with the highest die result wins.</p>
<h2 id="actions">Actions<a class="headerlink" href="#actions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Once it is a player&rsquo;s turn in a crisis, he or she may do two
actions. An action takes a small amount of time, and may involve a
skill check. The game master may decide that a task takes more than
one action, or even takes a couple of rounds. Any number of actions
may be converted to <strong>ready actions</strong>. These are specific conditions
set by the player that trigger when an external event occurs. If the
condition does not occur before his or her next turn, the <strong>ready
action</strong> is lost.</p>
<p>Everything you do in a crisis as part of an action is almost all of
the time solvable through a skill check. Movement in combat is done
through <strong>Acrobatics</strong>, hitting an enemy with a sword through
<strong>Melee</strong> or getting a blast door open uses <strong>Hacking</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="free-actions">Free Actions<a class="headerlink" href="#free-actions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>A game master may also decide that something takes so little time,
that it does not count towards the player&rsquo;s amount of actions in that
round. These actions are called <strong>free actions</strong>. For example, the
game master may decide that letting go of a ledge takes no time and is

<p>Reactions are skill checks that a player or NPC must make upon the
request of the game master. Reactions are triggered by external
events, and may happen out of turn for the player. The game master
sets a DC and a skill, which the player has to succeed or face certain
consequences. These reactions do not detract from the player or NPCs
available actions on his turn.</p>
<p>For example two players climb a mountain side. One player fails his
athletics check, slips and falls. The other player may receive a
reaction to catch him.  Should he fail his friend falls, and if he
succeeds he may help is friend to gain footing again.</p>
