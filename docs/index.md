## Mechanics

### Rolls & Checks

Whenever someone has to roll or make a check, you roll **3d6** and add any
bonuses or subtract any penalties from it.

### Fractions

All fractions are **always** rounded down.

### Negative Values

Some pools cannot be negative, e.g. [Resources](/character#resources-res),
[Endurance](/character#endurance) or [Health](/character#health). If such a
value where to drop to below 0, it either prohibits certain actions, it has
consequences or it's simply ignored and the value set to 0.

### Difficulty Level

NPCs are abstracted by a [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty).

Some conditions, that are also used by player characters, may provide a positive
or negative modifier to the [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty). If a value
is effected by a difficulty modifier, but the effected value requires a roll,
e.g. a player character's [Defence](/crisis#defence), the modifier simply adds a
bonus or penalty to the check. A difficulty modifier of `+1` adds a `+3` bonus,
and a difficulty modifier of `-1` adds a `-3` penalty.
