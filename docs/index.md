# Introduction

## Prerequisites

A player needs these dice: [d4](#d4), [d6](#d6), [d8](#d8), [d10](#d10) and a
[d12](#d12). A GM also requires these dice. A d20 or d100 also can be useful
when rolling on random tables.

## Mechanics

### Fractions

All fractions are **always** rounded down.

### Negative Values

Some pools cannot be negative, e.g. [Resources](/character#resources-res) and
[Endurance](/character#endurance). If such a value were to drop to below 0, it
either prohibits certain actions, it has consequences or it's simply ignored and
the value set to 0.

## Die Rolls

All creatures are defined by [Attributes](/character#attributes) and
[Skills](/character/skills#skills), which are used for all actions and die
rolls.

Checks are made if the outcome of a task is uncertain and subject to chance, or
influenced by other parties. A check involves rolling the character's die
corresponding to the attempted [Attribute](/character#attributes) or
[Skill](/character/skills#skills) check. Bonuses are added to the resulting die
roll, and compared to the task's [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty).

A task's [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty) is **always** 4. The only
exceptions are passive values in combat, e.g. a character's defense value.

A check has to be equal to or higher a [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty) in
order to succeed. Otherwise, the check fails. The [Difficulty
Level](/crisis#difficulty) can be modified by adding or substracting from the
rolls resulting number.

!!! info "Check Failures"
    A failed check doesn't necessarily mean, that the check completely failed.
    E.g. when climbing, a failed check might simply mean, that there was no
    progress while climbing. Or a failed sailing check might mean, that the
    voyage takes a few days longer.

### Exploding dice

Whenever a die is rolled with its highest possible result (e.g. rolling a 12 on
a [d12](#d12)), the die *explodes*. This allows you to roll the die again, and
add the result to your check. A die can explode multiple times.

### Critical Failures

When rolling a **one** with any die, you have to roll again. If it's another one
the check critically fails. Otherwise, calculate the total using the first die
roll (the **one**) and ignore the second one.

A critical fail causes other penalties in addition to failing the check, such as
loss of resources, items, reputation etc.

### Critical Successes

> A check may or may not have a critical outcome.

Every multiple of 4, beginning at 8, adds a critical success to the roll. The
[Skill](#skills), item or GM determines the outcome of the critical success.


!!! example "Critical Successes"
    Mary rolls a 14, with bonuses. This roll is worth 2 critical successes, one
    for reaching 8 and another for reaching 12.

### Contests

When two parties compete with each other in the same or even different
[Skill](/character/skills#skills) and stats, both parties have to make a check.
The party with the higher result wins the contest. On a tie both parties roll
again.

### Difficulty Level

Every Check has to beat a set [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty) in order to
be successful. The [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty) is influenced by
circumstances, making a check harder or easier.

*Contests* don't use [Difficulty Levels](/crisis#difficulty). *Contests* are
used, when both parties are *active* (rather than one party being *passive*) and
have to make a check and compare the results to see who is successful.

NPCs are abstracted by a [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty), and use this
level for almost all checks, stats, etc.

## Glossary

[Action point](/crisis#actions)
:   AP, used for atomic actions in a crisis.

Base Value
:   A base value that's used for rolls or to determine values. It's the same for
all characters and creatures.

Difficulty Class
:   DC, a check equal or higher than the DC is a success, or a failure
otherwise.

*Failure*{.qs-f}
:   This indicates, that a check failed or has to be failed.

Roleplaying Circumstance
:   Usually added by a race, perk or flaws. Roleplaying circumstances include
prejudice, others liking or disliking you, being a known criminal, etc.

*Success*{.qs-s}
:   This indicates, that a check was succeeded or has to be succeeded.

Weight
:   The minimum requirement of [Might](/character#might-mi) to *use* items.
Weight exceeding a character's [Might](/character#might-mi) imposes penalties.
