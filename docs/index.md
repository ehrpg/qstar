# Mechanisms

Anything that represents a character, creature, operational vessel, etc. is
defined by a set of features. The features listed here assume characters:

## Stats

All characters and vessels have primary stats, and secondary stats:

* primary stats:
    * Might / Firepower
    * Speed / Maneuverability
    * Intelligence / Subsystems
    * Charisma / Power-Level
* secondary stats:
    * Downtime / Fuel (spent)
        * Downtime --> Improving character, healing damage
        * Fuel --> Travel from origin to destination
    * Goods / Storage
        * Goods --> Goods are looted and stored in storage
        * Storage --> Storage space for trading goods
    * Resources / Resources (acquired)
        * Resources --> Used to buy and maintain powerful equipment
    * Technology / Technology (spent)
        * Technology --> Used to unlock uncommon upgrades

## Pools

All characters and vessels have two pools.

One for its health - if this pool drops to zero or below, the character dies or
vessel is destroyed.

Another one that serves the role of a secondary pool, that's easily
replenishable. If this pool drops to zero, all subsequent damage is dealth to
the first pool instead. The secondary pool dropping to zero has fatal
consequences in itself.

* pools:
    * Health
    * Endurance

## Race / Origin

All characters and vessels have a race or origin (for vessels). A race or origin
modify:

* primary stats
* secondary stats
* pools
* skills
* inherent perks/flaws

## Skills

All characters and vessels have skills. These skills are ranked from 0 to 5. A
skill at rank 0 imposes a penalty, and the others add bonuses.


## Perks & Flaws

Perks & Flaws require certain primary abilities, and provide bonuses to skills.
Also, some perks add the ability to use [stunts](#stunts).

## Stunts

Rolling a **6**{.qs-d6} with any roll on a check enables so called **stunts**.
Some **stunts** require two or even three **6**{.qs-d6} on a check to be used.

Every character has access to some generally available stunts. Special stunts
require [perks](/perks-flaws) and [equipment](/equipment).


## Equipment

All characters and vessels can be outfitted with equipment. Equipment makes a
character/vessel tougher, stronger, and add a bonus to skill checks.

# Improving your character

Improving your character takes time.

| Attribute    | Downtime |
|--------------|---------:|
| Primary stat |       10 |
| Skill        |        3 |
| Get Perk     |        2 |
| Remove Flaw  |        2 |
| Trade        |        1 |

!!! note "Cheaper improvements"
    Sometimes, a GM can decide that an improvement doesn't require as much
    downtime as listed above. For example, a character that focused on strength
    rather than charisma, may be attending a political party. Even if he didn't
    accomplish anything during the event, he may still have learned a trick or
    two. The GM could now reduce the downtime cost to 7 instead of 10 for
    improving the characters charisma.
