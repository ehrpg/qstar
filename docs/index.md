# Introduction

## Prerequisites

A player needs these dice: [d4](#d4), [d6](#d6), [d8](#d8), [d10](#d10) and a
[d12](#d12). A GM also requires these dice. A d20 or d100 also can be useful
when rolling on random tables.

## Basic Mechanics

### Fractions

All fractions are **always** rounded down.

When a Skill is halved, half the number of sides of the die. Flat modifiers are
added to the sides of the die.

!!! example "Skill Fraction"
    <div class="formula formula-top formula-bottom">
      <span data-bracket-bottom="Result">6</span> = (
      <span data-bracket-top="1d12">12</span> /
      <span data-bracket-bottom="divisor">2</span>)
    </div>

</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">

!!! example "Skill Fraction"
    <div class="formula formula-top formula-bottom">
      <span data-bracket-bottom="Result">7</span> = (
      <span data-bracket-top="1d12+3">15</span> /
      <span data-bracket-bottom="divisor">2</span>)
    </div>

</div>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

### Negative Values

Some pools cannot be negative, e.g. [Resources](/character#resources-res) and
[Endurance](/character#endurance). If such a value were to drop to below 0, it
either prohibits certain actions, it has consequences or it's simply ignored and
the value set to 0.

## Die Rolls

There are three different kind of die rolls:

* **Task** rolls, which include Skill rolls including Attacks,
* **Damage** rolls, and
* **Random** rolls.

All creatures are defined by [Attributes](/character#attributes) and
[Skills](/character/skills#skills), which are used for all **Task** rolls and
*most* **Damage** rolls.

Every roll uses a set amount of dice. **Task** rolls use the corresponding
[Attribute](/character#attributes)'s or [Skill](/character/skills#skills)'s die.
**Damage** rolls use the weapon's corresponding dice. Random rolls use the
random table's corresponding dice.

**Task** and **Damage** rolls receive bonuses and penalties from the creature's
perks, flaws, race, role-playing, etc.

**Task** rolls include something called a chance die in addition to the
[Attribute](/character#attributes)'s or [Skill](/character/skills#skills)'s die.
A chance die isn't added to the result. See [Critical
Failures](#critical-failures).

### Task Difficulty

A task's [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty) is **always** 4. The only
exceptions are passive values in combat, e.g. a character's defense value.

A check has to be equal to or higher a [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty) in
order to succeed. Otherwise, the check fails. The [Difficulty
Level](/crisis#difficulty) can be modified by adding or substracting from the
rolls resulting number.

!!! info "Check Failures"
    A failed check doesn't necessarily mean, that the check completely failed.
    E.g. when climbing, a failed check might simply mean, that there was no
    progress while climbing. Or a failed sailing check might mean, that the
    voyage takes a few days longer.

<div class="left" markdown="1">

### Critical Failures

If the chance die comes up with a 1, and the **Task**'s die also comes up with a
1, the task critically fails.

A critical fail causes other penalties in addition to failing the check, such as
loss of resources, items, reputation etc.

### Critical Successes

Whenever a die is rolled with its highest possible result (e.g. rolling a 10 on
a [d10](#d10)), the die *explodes*. This allows you to roll the die again, and
add the result to your check. A die can explode multiple times.

### Contests

When two parties compete with each other in the same or even different
[Skill](/character/skills#skills) and stats, both parties have to make a check.
The party with the higher result wins the contest. On a tie both parties roll
again.

## Glossary

[Action point](/crisis#actions)
:   AP, used for atomic actions in a crisis.

Base Value
:   A base value that's used for rolls or to determine values. It's the same for
all characters and creatures.

*Failure*{.qs-f}
:   This indicates, that a check failed or has to be failed for the described
outcome.

Roleplaying Circumstance
:   Usually added by a race, perks or flaws. Roleplaying circumstances include
prejudice, others liking or disliking you, being a known criminal, etc.

*Success*{.qs-s}
:   This indicates, that a check was succeeded or has to be succeeded for the
described outcome.

Weight
:   The minimum requirement of [Might](/character#might-mi) to *use* items.
Weight exceeding a character's [Might](/character#might-mi) imposes penalties.
