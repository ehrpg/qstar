# Introduction



## Prerequisites

A player needs these dice: d4, d6, d8, d10 and a d12. A GM also requires these
dice, or even more, to roll for NPCs, random outcomes, etc. A d20 or d100 also
can be useful when rolling on random tables.

## Mechanics

A character's skill and attributes are defined by his skill or attribute level.
Every character starts with a skill and attribute level at d4. This can be
improved up to a d12, or even higher adding flat bonuses, e.g. d12+1.

A task's difficulty is always 4. The only exceptions are passive values in
combat, e.g. a character's defense value.

Circumstances can modify a task's difficulty, so it becomes easier or harder to
master.

### Checks

Checks are made if the outcome of a task is uncertain or subject to chance. A
check involves rolling the character's die corresponding to the attempted skill
or attribute roll. Bonuses are added to the resulting die roll, and compared to
the task's difficulty level.

Whenever a die is rolled with it's highest possible result (e.g. rolling a 12 on
a d12), the die *explodes*. This allows you to roll the die again, and add the
result to your check. A die can explode multiple times.

The higher the resulting number, the better.

A check has to be equal to or higher a target number in order to succeed.
Otherwise, the check fails. The target number is derived from the task attempted
and the check made. Most checks are made for [Skills](/character/skills#skills)
and [Attributes](/character#attributes).

<!-- The target number for a Check and consequently the task's difficulty is modified
by:

* The [Attribute](/character#attributes) Modifier,
* the [Skill](/character/skills#skills) Modifier,
* [Perks](/character/perks-flaws#perks) and
  [Flaws](/character/perks-flaws#flaws),
* used [Equipment](/character/equipment),
* and other circumstances. -->

#### Contests

When two parties compete with each other in the same or even different skills
and stats, both parties have to make a check. The party with the higher result
wins the contest. On a tie, the defending party wins. If there is no defending
party, the tie is unresolved and nothing happens to either party.

#### Difficulty Level

Every Check has to beat a set [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty) in order to
be successful. The [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty) is influenced by
circumstances, increasing or decreasing the difficulty.

*Contests* don't use [Difficulty Levels](/crisis#difficulty). *Contests* are
used, when both parties are *active* (rather than one party being *passive*) and
have to make a check and compare the results to see who is successful.

NPCs are abstracted by a [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty), and use this
level for almost all checks, stats, etc.

#### Difficulty Modifier

A [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty) can **never** shift more than 2 levels
in any direction.

If a creative idea of a player would accomplish the same task and leaves little
to no room of error, then the GM *can* decide what to do. Here are some ideas:

* accept the creative solution as is,
* require the character to roll if he would come up with the idea himself,
* require the character to roll to see *how well* the solution is executed,
* etc.

### Fractions

All fractions are **always** rounded down.

### Negative Values

Some pools cannot be negative, e.g. [Resources](/character#resources-res) and
[Endurance](/character#endurance). If such a value where to drop to below 0, it
either prohibits certain actions, it has consequences or it's simply ignored and
the value set to 0.

## Glossary

[Action point](/crisis#actions)
:   AP, used for atomic actions in a crisis.

Base
:   A base value that's used for rolls or to determine values. It's the same for
all characters and creatures.

Difficulty Class
:   DC, a check equal or higher than the DC is a success, or a failure
otherwise.

*Failure*{.qs-f}
:   This indicates, that a check failed or has to be failed.

Roleplaying Circumstance
:   Usually added by a race, perk or flaws. Roleplaying circumstances include
prejudice, others liking or disliking you, being a known criminal, etc.

*Roll*{.qs-one}
:   This indicates, that a die on a check is a **1**. The number of dice show
the number of **1**s that have to be rolled.

*Roll*{.qs-d6}
:   This indicates, that a die on a check is a **6**. The number of dice show
the number of **6**s that have to be rolled.

*Success*{.qs-s}
:   This indicates, that a check was succeeded or has to be succeeded.

Weight
:   The minimum requirement of [Might](/character#might-mi) to *use* items.
Weight exceeding a character's [Might](/character#might-mi) imposes penalties.
