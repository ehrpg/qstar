# Introduction

This is an easy-to-learn and adaptable RPG system for games such as pen and
paper games. It's heavily enspired by great RPGs and RPG systems such as
Divinity: Original Sin, Dungeons & Dragons, Mindjammer, Fragged Empire, Savage
Worlds, etc.

It aims to provide an RPG system that's usable for any kind of play and for any
setting such as medieval, fantasy, modern, sci-fi settings or even a combination
of any of these.

## Prerequisites

Every player and the GM need three six sided dice. A d20 or d100 also can be
useful when rolling on random tables.

## Basic Mechanics

<div class="content" markdown="1">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> ![](./_imgs/3d6.png) </td>
<td>
Everything a character does involves a Skill check. A Skill check is always made
using three six sided dice, abbreviated by [3d6](#3d6). The **higher** the
result, the **better**.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>[](#d6)</td>
<td>A rolled **6** counts as a critical success.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2.5</td>
<td>All fractions are **always** rounded down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-1</td>
<td>
Some values cannot be negative, e.g. [Resources](/character#resources-res). If
such a value were to drop to below 0, it either prohibits certain actions, it
has **consequences** or it's simply ignored and the value set to 0.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i class="qstar-tornado"></i></td>
<td>
Most of the formulas and values can be influenced by circumstance, such as
racial traits, talents, equipment, environmental factors such as bad or
particularly good visibility, wind, etc.
</td>
</tr>

</table>

## Die Rolls

There are three different kind of die rolls, whereas each one uses a set amount
of dice:

* **Skill** rolls use [3d6](#3d6) dice;
* **Damage** rolls use the weapon's corresponding dice; and
* **Random** rolls use the random table's corresponding dice.

### Critical Successes

Whenever a [d6](#d6) is rolled with its highest possible result, a **6**, you
score a Critical Success. Only **Skill** rolls can have Critical Successes. A
critical success does not influence the outcome of the **Skill** roll, they only
allow for additional effects, e.g. when Attacking.
