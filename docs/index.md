# Introduction

## Mechanics

### Rolls & Checks

Whenever someone has to roll or make a check, you roll **3d6**. Add all dice
together. The resulting number **has** to be less than or equal to the target
number. A higher target number means a better chance of success.

A target number is usually a creature's [Ability](/character#abilities),
modified by a task's difficulty, circumstances such as perks, flaws and
equipment, and the creature's [Skill](/character/skills#skills) Rank.

### Results

#### Fractions

All fractions are **always** rounded down.

#### Negative Values

Some pools cannot be negative, e.g. [Resources](/character#resources-res),
[Endurance](/character#endurance) or [Health](/character#health). If such a
value where to drop to below 0, it either prohibits certain actions, it has
consequences or it's simply ignored and the value set to 0.
