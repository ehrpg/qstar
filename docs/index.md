# Introduction

## Prerequisites

A player needs these dice: [d4](#d4), [d6](#d6), [d8](#d8), [d10](#d10) and a
[d12](#d12). A GM also requires these dice. A d20 or d100 also can be useful
when rolling on random tables.

## Mechanics

### Fractions

All fractions are **always** rounded down.

### Negative Values

Some pools cannot be negative, e.g. [Resources](/character#resources-res) and
[Endurance](/character#endurance). If such a value where to drop to below 0, it
either prohibits certain actions, it has consequences or it's simply ignored and
the value set to 0.

## Die Rolls

All creatures are defined by [Attributes](/character#attributes) and
[Skills](/character/skills#skills), which are used for all actions and die
rolls.

A task's difficulty is always 4. The only exceptions are passive values in
combat, e.g. a character's defense value.

Checks are made if the outcome of a task is uncertain and subject to chance, or
influenced by others. A check involves rolling the character's die corresponding
to the attempted skill or attribute roll. Bonuses are added to the resulting die
roll, and compared to the task's difficulty level.

Whenever a die is rolled with it's highest possible result (e.g. rolling a 12 on
a [d12](#d12)), the die *explodes*. This allows you to roll the die again, and
add the result to your check. A die can explode multiple times.

A check has to be equal to or higher a target number in order to succeed.
Otherwise, the check fails. The target number is derived from the task attempted
and the check made. Most checks are made for [Skills](/character/skills#skills)
and [Attributes](/character#attributess).


### Critical Failures

When rolling a one with any die, you have to roll again. If it's another one the
check critically fails. Otherwise, calculate the total using the first die roll
and ignored the second one.

This incurs other penalties in addition to failing the check, such as loss of
resources, items, reputation etc.

### Critical Successes

Every multiple of 4, beginning at 8, adds a critical success to the roll. The
[Skill](#skills), item or GM determines the outcome of the critical success.

> A check may not have a critical outcome, or it doesn't matter if it's a
critical success or not.

!!! example "Critical Successes"
    Mary rolls a 14, with bonuses. This roll is worth 2 critical successes, one
    for reaching 8 and another for reaching 12.

### Normal Failures

A failed check doesn't necessarily mean, that the check completely failed. E.g.
when climbing, a failed check might simply mean, that there was no progress
while climbing. Or a failed sailing check might mean, that the voyage took a few
days longer.

### Contests

When two parties compete with each other in the same or even different skills
and stats, both parties have to make a check. The party with the higher result
wins the contest. On a tie both parties roll again.

### Difficulty Level

Every Check has to beat a set [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty) in order to
be successful. The [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty) is influenced by
circumstances, increasing or decreasing the difficulty.

*Contests* don't use [Difficulty Levels](/crisis#difficulty). *Contests* are
used, when both parties are *active* (rather than one party being *passive*) and
have to make a check and compare the results to see who is successful.

NPCs are abstracted by a [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty), and use this
level for almost all checks, stats, etc.

## Glossary

[Action point](/crisis#actions)
:   AP, used for atomic actions in a crisis.

Base Value
:   A base value that's used for rolls or to determine values. It's the same for
all characters and creatures.

Difficulty Class
:   DC, a check equal or higher than the DC is a success, or a failure
otherwise.

*Failure*{.qs-f}
:   This indicates, that a check failed or has to be failed.

Roleplaying Circumstance
:   Usually added by a race, perk or flaws. Roleplaying circumstances include
prejudice, others liking or disliking you, being a known criminal, etc.

*Success*{.qs-s}
:   This indicates, that a check was succeeded or has to be succeeded.

Weight
:   The minimum requirement of [Might](/character#might-mi) to *use* items.
Weight exceeding a character's [Might](/character#might-mi) imposes penalties.
