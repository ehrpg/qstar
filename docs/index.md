## Mechanics

### Rolls & Checks

Whenever someone has to roll or make a check, you roll **3d6** and add any
bonuses or subtract any penalties from it.

### Fractions

All fractions are **always** rounded down.

### Negative Values

Some pools cannot be negative, e.g. [Resources](/character#resources-res),
[Endurance](/character#endurance) or [Health](/character#health). If such a
value where to drop to below 0, it either prohibits certain actions, it has
consequences or it's simply ignored and the value set to 0.
