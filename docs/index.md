## Mechanics

### Rolls & Checks

Whenever someone has to roll or make a check, you roll **3d6** and add any
bonuses or subtract any penalties from it.

### Results

#### Fractions

All fractions are **always** rounded down.

#### Negative Values

Some pools cannot be negative, e.g. [Resources](/character#resources-res),
[Endurance](/character#endurance) or [Health](/character#health). If such a
value where to drop to below 0, it either prohibits certain actions, it has
consequences or it's simply ignored and the value set to 0.

### Difficulty Level

Every roll or check has to beat a set [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty) in
order to be successful. The [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty) is influenced
by circumstances, increasing or decreasing the difficulty.

*Contests* don't use [Difficulty Levels](/crisis#difficulty). *Contests* are
used, when both parties are *active* (rather than one party being *passive*) and
have to make a check and compare the results to see who is successful.

NPCs are abstracted by a [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty), and use this
level for almost all checks, stats, etc.

Some conditions, that are also used by player characters, may provide a positive
or negative modifier to the [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty). If a value
is effected by a difficulty modifier, but the effected value requires a roll,
e.g. a player character's [Defence](/crisis#defence), the modifier simply adds a
bonus or penalty to the check. A difficulty modifier of `+1` adds a `+3` bonus,
and a difficulty modifier of `-1` adds a `-3` penalty.

#### Difficulty Modifier

A [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty) can **never** shift more than 2 levels
in any direction.

If a creative idea of a player would accomplish the same task and leaves little
to no room of error, then the GM *can* decide what to do. Here are some ideas:

* accept the creative solution as is,
* require the character to roll if he would come up with the idea himself,
* require the character to roll to see *how well* the solution is executed,
* etc.

#### Contests

When two parties enter a *contest*, they both have to roll on a skill or stat.
E.g. a sneaking character has to roll *Stealth*, while a guard would roll on
*Perception*.
