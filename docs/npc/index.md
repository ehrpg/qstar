# Non-Player Characters

Most characters the GM is playing and enemies are Non-Player Characters (NPCs).
NPCs reduce the rule overhead to make it easier for the GM to manage multiple
characters at once.

A GM can however create normal characters in place of NPCs to flesh them out
more.


## Difficulty Level

NPCs don't use [Downtime](/character#downtime). Instead an NPC has a [Difficulty
Level](/crisis#difficulty) that describes how well trained, tough and strong it
is.

## Abilities & Skills

An NPC has each [Ability](/character#abilities) and [Skill](/skills#skills) at
rank **Mediocre**. Any of those values can be shifted by one (either increased
or decreasing the value). Decreasing an [Ability](/character#abilities) allows
the NPC to increase another [Ability](/character#abilities). Decreasing a
[Skill](/skills#skills) allows the NPC to increase another
[Skill](/skills#skills).

In addition, a NPC receives a number of extra *points* to further increase
[Abilities](/character#abilities) and [Skills](/skills#skills). An NPC's
[Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty) allows them to change any of the two
without lowering any other first.
