# Non-Player Characters

Most characters the GM is playing and enemies are Non-Player Characters (NPCs).
NPCs reduce the rule overhead to make it easier for the GM to manage multiple
characters at once.

A GM can however create normal characters in place of NPCs to flesh them out
more.

## Loot

An NPC can drop items, but doesn't have to. E.g. animals do not drop items, but
can be butchered for food, or skinned to make a profit later.

[Credits](/equipment#credits) only make a small portion of the loot, if any at
all. The most valuable kind of loot are [Resources](/character#resources-res).

### Credits


### Items

Items an NPC was using can also be looted. Depending on the combat, most items
have a bad [Equipment Condition](/equipment#equipment-condition)
though.

#### Equipment Condition

Stronger NPCs with a higher [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty) use better
items.
