# Non-Player Characters

Most characters the GM is playing and enemies are Non-Player Characters (NPCs).
NPCs reduce the rule overhead to make it easier for the GM to manage multiple
characters at once.

A GM can however create normal characters in place of NPCs to flesh them out
more.

## Action Points

Instead of Action Points, NPCs use the Action system. An NPC can do any 2
Actions, such as Move, Attack, Sneak, etc. Left-over Actions are lost; they
cannot be accumulated over multiple rounds.

## Loot

An NPC can drop items, but doesn't have to. E.g. animals do not drop items, but
can be butchered for food, or skinned to make a profit later.

[Credits](/equipment#credits) only make a small portion of the loot, if any at
all. The most valuable kinds of loot are [Loot](/character#loot) and
[Resources](/character#resources-res).

### Credits


### Items

Items an NPC was using can also be looted. Depending on the combat, most items
have a bad [Equipment Condition](/equipment#equipment-condition)
though.
