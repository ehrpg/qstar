# Character creation

> This section outlines the steps necessary to create a character from scratch
> while creating an example character. It assumes that you are somehow familiar
> with either the Q* rules or P&P RPG Systems in general. For detailed rules see
> the corresponding sections.

At character creation, and while gameplay, each improvement costs
[Downtime](/character#downtime-dt). The [Downtime](/character#downtime-dt) costs are
listed in the corresponding sections, e.g. [Abilities](/character#abilities) and
[Skills](/character/skills#skills). Improvements while gameplay can also require
additional circumstances, e.g. upgrading [Might](/character#might-mi) could cost
[Credits](/equipment#credits) to cybernatically enhance the character.

Every creature starts with an amount of [Downtime](/character#downtime-dt) that can
be used to improve your character. Decreasing your character's power through
lowering ranks or *buying* [Flaws](/character/flaws) nets you
[Downtime](/character#downtime-dt), but only to an extent. E.g. a GM can restrict
you in how far you can lower an [Ability](/character#abilities) or a
[Skill](/character/skills#skills).

**During** character creation, the global maximum for
[Downtime](/character#downtime-dt) can exceed 10.

The [Downtime](/character#downtime-dt) received for character creation is
determined by the creature's [Race](/character/races) and
[Flaws](/character/flaws).

Also, while creating a character [Downtime](/character#downtime-dt) can be
traded for any other Means. One [Downtime](/character#downtime-dt) provides two
of any other Means, or one of two Currencies each. E.g. a rich businessman could
trade some of his [Downtime](/character#downtime-dt) for
[Resources](/character#resources-res) or [Influence](/character#influence-inf)

!!! example "Example character idea"
    In this example we use the scifi Q* setting. Our character is a human
    bio-engineer, who has been trained for off-world operations. As such, he
    knows how to handle light weapons. He has a lot of connections from his
    earlier life at the research institute he was working at.

    The following sub-sections show how this idea translates into the Q* - RPG
    System.

## Buying / Reducing Downtime

[Downtime](#downtime-dt) cost can be reduced for improvements by spending
[Credits](/equipment#credits). The [Downtime](#downtime-dt) cost can never be
lower than 1.

In addition to [Credits](/equipment#credits) cost, lowering the
[Downtime](/character#downtime-dt) can also require additional circumstances, such
as trainers, shops, items, etc.

## Abilities

Every creature starts with its Ability ranks set to [Ability -
Poor](/character#abilities), unless otherwise noted by its
[Race](/character/races) and [Flaws](/character/flaws).

## Skills

Every creature starts with its Skill ranks set to [Skill -
Poor](/character/skills#skills), unless otherwise noted by its
[Race](/character/races) and [Flaws](/character/flaws).

Additionally, Skill ranks can never be higher than their corresponding Ability
ranks.

!!! example "Example"
    A character with [Might - Good](/character#might-mi) can never have a might
    skill at rank [Skill - Great](/character/skills#skills) or better.

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Choose a race

!!! example "Example character"
    Our character is human. The human race provides us with the perk
    [Versatile](/character/perks-flaws#versatile), which gives us another [Skill
    Point](/character/skills#skill-points). We also gain 2 [Flaws](/character/flaws)
    however. Let's make a mental note and pick them later.

### 2. Assign abilities

!!! example "Example character"
    Our character focuses on [Intelligence](/character#intelligence-in), then
    [Charisma](/character#charisma-ch), then [Speed](/character#speed-sp), and last
    but not least [Might](/character#might-mi).

    We have 12 [Ability Points](/character#abilities) to spend. We'll assign 5
    to [Intelligence](/character#intelligence-in), 3 to
    [Charisma](/character#charisma-ch), 2 to [Speed](/character#speed-sp) and 2 to
    [Might](/character#might-mi).

### 3. Assign flaws

!!! example "Example character"

### 4. Buy perks

!!! example "Example character"

### 4. Assign skills

!!! example "Example character"
    Our character has 5 [Intelligence](/character#intelligence-in), resulting in an
    Ability Modifier of +3. We now have a total of 9 [Skill
    Points](/character/skills#skill-points): 5 Base, +3 from the positive Ability
    modifier, and +1 from the [Versatile](/character/perks-flaws#versatile) perk.

    We will focus on *Science - Biology*. Since it's our first Science skill
    pick, we can pick two different fields. So we'll take *Science - Biology*
    and *Science - Chemistry*. Let's upgrade this skill to master rank, reducing
    our [Skill Points](/character/skills#skill-points) by 3. Also, we now can only have
    two more skills at master rank.

    Next, we'll upgrade the *Backstory* skill to skilled rank. Reducing our
    [Skill Points](/character/skills#skill-points) by 2.

    Let's upgrade the *Light Weapons* to trained, reducing our
    [Skill Points](/character/skills#skill-points) by 1.

    With the remaining 3 [Skill Points](/character/skills#skill-points) we improve the
    following skills to trained: Athletics, Perception, Oratory.

### 7. Buy equipment

### 3. Determine maximum currencies

### 8. Adjust character values
