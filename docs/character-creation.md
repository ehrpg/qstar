> This section outlines the steps necessary to create a character from scratch
> while creating an example character. It assumes that you are somehow familiar
> with either the Q* rules or P&P RPG Systems in general. For detailed rules see
> the corresponding sections.

!!! example "Example character idea"
    In this example we use the scifi Q* setting. Our character is a human
    bio-engineer, who has been trained for off-world operations. As such, he
    knows how to handle pistols and alike. He has a lot of connections from his
    earlier life at the research institute he was working for.

    The following sections show how this idea translates into the Q* - RPG
    System.

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Choose a race

!!! example "Example character"
    Our character is human. The human race provides us with the perk
    [Versatile](/perks-flaws#versatile), which gives us another [Skill
    Point](/skills#skill-points). We also gain 2 [Flaws](/perks-flaws#flaws)
    however. Let's make a mental note and pick them later.

### 2. Assign abilities

!!! example "Example character"
    Our character focuses on [Intelligence](/character#intelligence), then
    [Charisma](/character#charisma), then [Speed](/character#speed), and last
    but not least [Might](/character#might).

    We have 12 [Ability Points](/character#abilities) to spend. We'll assign 5
    to [Intelligence](/character#intelligence), 3 to
    [Charisma](/character#charisma), 2 to [Speed](/character#speed) and 2 to
    [Might](/character#might).

### 3. Assign flaws

### 4. Buy perks

### 4. Assign skills

!!! example "Example character"
    Our character has 5 [Intelligence](/character#intelligence), resulting in an
    Ability modifier of +3. We now have a total of 9 [Skill
    Points](/skills#skill-points): 5 Base, +3 from the positive Ability
    modifier, and +1 from the [Versatile](/perks-flaws#versatile) perk.

    We will focus on *Science - Biology*. Since it's our first Science skill
    pick, we can pick two different fields. So we'll take *Science - Biology*
    and *Science - Chemistry*. Let's upgrade this skill to master rank, reducing
    our [Skill Points](/skills#skill-points) by 3. Also, we now can only have
    two more skills at master rank.

    Next, we'll upgrade the *Backstory* skill to skilled rank. Reducing our
    [Skill Points](/skills#skill-points) by 2.

    Let's upgrade the *Light Weapons* to trained, reducing our
    [Skill Points](/skills#skill-points) by 1.

    With the remaining 3 [Skill Points](/skills#skill-points) we improve the
    following skills to trained: Athletics, Perception, Oratory.

### 7. Buy equipment
