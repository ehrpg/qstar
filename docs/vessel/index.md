# Vessel

## Attributes

#### Firepower

Firepower represents the vessel's energy distribution for weapon systems. More
energy equals more damage.

#### Maneuverability

Maneuverability represents the vessel's turning speed and speed both in combat
and while traveling. Better drives, slicker vessel designs and more power for
engines improve the overall maneuverability of a vessel.

#### Subsystems

Subsystems represent the quality of the ship's internal components, such as
shield generators, sensors, fuel, etc.

### Secondary

Secondary stats are bound to change quite often. Every secondary stat has a
maximum value modified by circumstances, upgrades, and initally by the vessel's
design. The current value of a secondary stat can **never** exceed the maximum
value. All exceeding points are usually lost.

#### Fuel

Every vessel uses fuel of some sort. A vessel without fuel cannot operate
anymore.

#### Storage

Storage space is limited by the vessel's design. upgrades can upgrade storage size.

#### Resources

Resources abstract materials and energy used for upgrades. Upgrading a vessel
requires resources to buy and maintain.

    </div>

#### Technology

Upgrades require technology. upgrades for the vessel require technology to buy
and maintain. A vessel restricts the unlockable technology by its maximum
technology value. This value is fixed for each vessel and can never be changed.

## Origin

Every vessel manufacturer creates special versions of vessels.

An origin modifies:

* primary and secondary stats,
* adds upgrades or flaws,
* enables access to inherent Attributes,
* and may add roleplaying circumstances.

## Pools

### Hull

A vessel at zero hull is destroyed.

### Shields

A vessel at zero shields is rendered inert and becomes an easy target to e.g.
weapons and boarding parties.
