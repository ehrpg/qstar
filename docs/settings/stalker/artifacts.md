# Artifacts

*Artifacts are items that have been created or changed by the conditions
of the zone. Artifacts exhibit strange properties, which can either be
helpful or also detrimental to the person wielding them. They are highly
sought after, both by scientists who wish to study their properties, as well
as large and powerful corporations who are willing to pay a hefty price to
obtain them from the Zone.*

## Creation

*Artifacts are created in the intense and hostile conditions in the Zone,
and many artifacts are created within anomalies. Emissions are known
to be the catalyst in the actual creation of an artifact, although
scientists in the zone are still unable to explain how this happens.*

## Uses

*Many artifacts have wondrous properties, allowing the wearer to resist
more damage, or will absorb radiation. Artifacts are also heavily
sought after by both outside sources and scientists, who will pay a
hefty price for any recovered artifact. Many stalkers earn money by
hunting and selling artefacts to vendors.*

To gain the advantages from artifacts they must be worn in **direct
contact** with the skin. This also exposes the wearer of the artifact
to any harmful radiation it might emit.

## Finding Artifacts

Most artifacts can only be found in highly dangerous and anomalous
areas, and **require a detector** to be found.

## List of Artifacts

### Battery

The composition of this artifact includes electrostatic elements,
but scientists have yet to identify the exact physical conditions
required for its formation. The artifact is popular in the Zone
and valued by its residents and visitors for its energizing and
regenerative properties, although it can tire the body out through
prolonged use. Emits radiation.

**Effects**: +3 Maximum Endurance, +5 RAD/hour

**Price**: 1500 RU

### Shell

This artifact used to be considered inert, devoid of any useful
properties. However, scientists recently discovered that if kept
in constant contact with the body, it has an excellent stimulating
effect on the nervous system. Emits radiation.

**Effects**: +6 Maximum Endurance, +10 RAD/hour

**Price**: 3300 RU

### Snowflake

At first glance this artifact resembles a Kolobok. Some claim that it
is actually a Kolobok, its properties reinforced by exposure to a
powerful electric field. Thanks to its unique properties, the artifact
can significantly increase the bearer's muscle tone. Emits radiation.

**Effects**: +9 Maximum Endurance, +15 RAD/hour

**Price**: 7000 RU

### Soul

A unique organic artifact with properties just as unique. Somehow
it increases the body's overall recovery rate from damage of any kind,
without accelerating the accumulation of toxins. Thanks to its effects
and appearance, this artifact is a valuable collector's item. Emits
radiation.

**Effects**: +2 Health/hour, 10 RAD/hour

**Price**: 4000 RU

### Kolobok

A relatively rare artifact that forms in areas contaminated with
chemicals, Kolobok is highly valued for its ability to heal wounds
of any kind in mere minutes. For unknown reasons, scientists are
spreading rumours among stalkers that the artifact interacts
with the bearer's genetic code. The artifact looks similar to
a sea urchin. Emits radiation.

**Effects**: +4 Health/hour, +10 RAD/hour

**Price**: 9000 RU

### Firefly

Firefly interacts with fields unknown to science, considerably speeding
up regeneration of tissue and organs in living beings, as well as
normalising metabolic processes. This artifact can literally get a badly
wounded stalker back on his feet in seconds. Unfortunately, Firefly is
extremely rare.

**Effects**: +6 Health/hour, +15 RAD/hour

**Price**: 16000 RU

### Stone Flower

This artifact is made up of granite-like stone deformed by an extreme
gravitational force, resulting in a crystallised formation that has not
been explained by science to date. Can provide moderate protection
against psy-emissions. Emits radiation.

**Effects**: 3 DR against psy damage, +5 RAD/hour

**Price**: 2500 RU

### Moonlight

This unique electrostatic artifact can resonate under the influence
of psy-waves. Stalkers and scientists have learned to fine tune
this artifact so that it resonates in opposite phase to the main
source of psy emissions, thus fully or significantly neutralising
their effects. Emits radiation.

**Effects**: 6 DR against psy damage, +10 RAD/hour

**Price**: 5000 RU

### Nightstar

This glowing artifact can generate a local directed law-gravity field.
Widely used by stalkers along with [Gravi](#gravi), a similar artifact,
to increase maximum carrying capacity. Emits radiation.

**Effects**: +4 kg carrying capacity, +5 RAD/hour

**Price**: 4200 RU

### Gravi

Gravi is formed from metallic substances exposed to prolonged gravitation.
This makes it capable of sustaining an anti-gravitational field, and
many stalkers use it to reduce the weight of their backpacks. Emits
radiation.

**Effects**: +8 kg carrying capacity, +10 RAD/hour

**Price:** 8000 RU

### Goldfish

The result of interaction between large number of gravitation fields,
Goldfish produces its own strong directed gravitational field, which
renders items within its range almost weightless. This artifact is
most effective for reducing carried weight, which explains why it is
always in great demand. Emits radiation.

**Effects**: +12 kg carrying capacity, +15 RAD/hour

**Price**: 24000 RU

### Jellyfish

This gravitation artifact attracts and absorbs radioactive particles,
reducing the effects of radiation on the body. Very common in the Zone
and is unofficially used outside the Zone for treating acute radiation
sickness in exceptional circumstances.

**Effects**: -10 RAD/hour

**Price**: 2000 RU

### Wrenched

This bizarrely-shaped artifact appears in placed with increased
gravitational activity. Acting as a kind of sponge that absorbs radio-active
elements, this artifact provides protection from outside radiation
as well as from radioactive particles that have already made their
way into the body.

**Effects**: -15 RAD/hour

**Price**: 7000 RU

### Bubble

A compound of several hollow organic formations, this artifact emits a
gaseous substance that can neutralise radioactive particles inside the
body without harming it. Because of its effectiveness, this artifact is
in great demand.

**Effects**: -20 RAD/hour

**Price**: 15500 RU

### Compass

A rare artifact - it's been several years since one was found. The
artifact can locate gaps in anomaly fields, effectively acting as a compass.
It is believed that it ca help one traverse the most complex anomaly fields
completely unharmed. However, very few know how to handle it properly.

**Effects**: One additional d10 when making survival checks. +20 RAD/hour

**Price**: 34000 RU

### Crystal

This artifact is formed in anomalous zones with intense thermal activity.
Actively consumes excessive heat, remaining cool to the touch throughout.
Emits radiation.

**Effects**: 3 DR against fire damage, +5 RAD/hour

**Price**: 1000 RU

### Fireball

Even though fireball is a thermal artifact, it can be handled without fear
of being burned. This artifact is valued for its ability to maintain a
temperature of 25 degrees within a small radius, virtually regardless of
its surroundings. Emits radiation.

**Effects**: 6 DR against fire damage, +10 RAD/hour

**Price**: 2500 RU

### Sparkler

A bright representative of the electrostatic family of artifacts. This
artifact can smooth fluctuations on electric field density. Emits radiation.

**Effects**: 3 DR against electricity damage, +5 RAD/hour

**Price**: 900 RU

### Flash

This electrostatic artifact is a powerful absorbent of electricity, which
later discharges. Flash is capable of protecting its bearer from electric
shocks of up to 5,000 volts. Emits radiation.

**Effects**: 6 DR against electricity damage, +10 RAD/hour

**Price**: 2000 RU

### Stone Blood

A reddish formation of compressed and fossilised plants, soil and animal
debris. Can partially neutralise chemical poisons. Emits radiation.

**Effects**: 3 DR against acid, +5 RAD/hour

**Price**: 1500 RU

### Meat Chunk

This organic artifact consists of deformed, mutated animal tissue. When
placed in a chemically contaminated area, Meat Chunk transforms the
airborne chemicals into a mucous fluid. Emits radiation.

**Effects**: 6 DR against acid, +10 RAD/hour

**Price**: 4000 RU
