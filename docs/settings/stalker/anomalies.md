*After the second Chernobyl disaster, the Zone was littered with spots
where the laws of nature and physics had been corrupted. These small
oddities are called anomalies. They are hazardous, often deadly,
towards human beings and other creatures as they can deliver electric
shocks or burn, corrode and distort physical objects. Most anomalies
produce visible air or light distortions, so their extent can be
determined by throwing anything that is made of metal, like bolts, to
trigger them. The anomalies seem to emit a powerful magnetic field, so
it is logical to assume that the anomalies are triggered by anything
made of metal that enters the magnetic field. Because vertebrate life
on earth has iron-based blood, those creatures with enough body mass
are capable of triggering the anomalies.*

## Springboard

*It was one of the first types of anomalies ever recorded. A
Springboard is an unstable gravitational field limited to a pocket on
ground level, about 1-2 meters wide. Reacts to the presence of
creatures or objects by sending out a powerful shock wave that damages
anything within radius. The damage caused by this changes throughout
the anomaly's lifetime, ranging from minor bruises through serious
wounds to instant death.*

A Springboard anomaly has an activation radius of roughly 2 to 4
metres. Once triggered it sends out a shock wave that does **4d6
points of critical damage** to anyone within its radius.

Known to produce the following artifacts:
[Jellyfish](../artifacts/#jellyfish),
[Nightstar](../artifacts/#nightstar),
[Stone Flower](../artifacts/#stone-flower).

## Whirligig

*A common and dangerous anomaly, which snatches its victims up in the
air and spins them at a breakneck speed. The exact nature of the
Whirligig remains unknown. The anomaly can be recognized by a light
whirlwind of dust above and by body fragments scattered in the
vicinity. Victims caught on its outer rim, far enough from the maximum
effect zone at the center, can escape the Whirligig with relatively
minor injuries.*

The whirligig is a weaker form of the [Vortex](#Vortex) anomaly. It is
often found off the ground and pulls unsuspecting victims into the air
towards its centre. The whirligig has an activation radius of roughly
8 to 10 metres. It is possible to escape the anti-gravitational pull
of a Whirligig by holding onto something solid on the ground, or by
being helped by someone outside its pull. Anyone within **15 metres of
the explosion takes 2d6 points of critical damage**, everyone **within
5 metres takes 4d6 points of critical damage**, and everyone within 1
metre of the explosion (including directly at the centre) is killed
instantly.

Known to produce the following artifacts:
[Stone Blood](../artifacts/#stone-blood),
[Meat Chunk](../artifacts/#meat-chunk),
[Wrenched](../artifacts/#wrenched),
[Soul](../artifacts/#soul).

## Vortex

*An anomaly of presumably gravitational nature. When triggered, the
tremendous power of the Vortex drags everything within the radius
10-15 meters towards the center. Victims drawn into the core have
little to no chance of survival: their bodies are quickly constricted
into a tight lump, only to be blown up in a powerful discharge of
energy a moment later.  In some cases, they may levitate in air with
agony, and soon their entire systems are shredded into mere skeletal
and flesh parts.*

Once triggered this anomaly drags everything within a radius of 15
metres into its centre. After a short amount of the time the vortex
anomaly explodes killing anything that has been dragged into its
centre. It is only possible to escape the pull by holding onto something
solid. The vortex will explode after a set amount of time, regardless
of whether something was pulled into its centre or not. Anyone within
**15 metres of the explosion takes 4d6 points of critical damage**,
everyone **within 5 metres takes 8d6 points of critical damage**, and
everyone within 1 metre of the explosion (including directly at the
centre) is killed instantly.

Known to produce the following artifacts:
[Nightstar](../artifacts/#nightstar),
[Gravi](../artifacts/#gravi),
[Goldfish](../artifacts/#goldfish).

## Burner

*The Burner can be a bit difficult to see, even in daylight, as it's
only revealed by a faint heat haze. If the anomaly is triggered by
either a living being or an object such as a metal bolt, it shoots out
a tall pillar of flame in the air, burning everything in its
vicinity. Though somewhat rare, the Burner anomaly is often found in
clusters.*

Once a Burner is triggered it shoots out a directed flame of roughly
four metres in length. Anything within its path takes **4 points of
fire damage per second**. Experienced stalkers are capable of dodging
the directed flaming jet of a Burner.

Known to produce the following artifacts:
[Crystal](../artifacts/#crystal),
[Fireball](../artifacts/#fireball).

## Comet

*The Comet anomaly functions much like a Burner anomaly in that it
deals fire damage on close contact, but with a key difference in that
the Comet is mobile, hovering around within a certain area at a rapid
pace.*

A Comet anomaly is always moving, either in a circle, or following along
a straight path. It will not stop after having hit something (or someone)
and will always follow its path. Being hit by a comet deals **2d6 points of
impact damage, and 2d6 points of fire damage**.

## Fruit Punch

*The Fruit Punch is a puddle of lambent green liquid that is easily
visible in almost any environment due to its bright glow and
distinctive hissing and bubbling noises. On contact with creatures or
objects such as bolts, a Fruit Punch lights up brightly and emits a
sharp hissing sound. It is extremely corrosive, damaging creatures and
objects on contact.*

A Fruit Punch as an activation radius between **one and two metres**.
Once activated it deals **3d6 points of acid damage** to anyone caught
within it. Any matter left within the Fruit Punch anomaly is usually
dissolved within a few hours.

Known to produce the following artifacts:
[Stone Blood](../artifacts/#stone-blood),
[Meat Chunk](../artifacts/#meat-chunk),
[Kolobok](../artifacts/#kolobok),
[Firefly](../artifacts/#firefly) (rarely),
[Bubble](../artifacts/#bubble) (rarely).

## Electro

*An anomalous formation, roughly 10 meters in diameter, accumulating
large quantities of static electricity. When triggered, the anomaly
bursts into a storm of arcing electricity nearly always lethal to all
living beings. Easily recognizable by the blue gas it emits, along
with the endless arcing of small bolts of electricity in the
vicinity.*

Once triggered the anomaly does **10d6 points electricity damage**,
which is equally distributed among all those within it's path.

Known to produce the following artifacts:
[Sparkler](../artifacts/#sparkler),
[Flash](../artifacts/#flash),
[Moonlight](../artifacts/#moonlight),
[Battery](../artifacts/#battery),
[Shell](../artifacts/#shell).
[Snowflake](../artifacts/#snowflake).

## Burnt Fuzz

*This anomaly is usually found outdoors. It resembles moss or vines,
hanging down like curtains from its growing spot. Reacts to rapidly
approaching living beings by discharging a cloud of projectiles
severely injuring uncovered or lightly protected skin upon
contact. Does not react to slowly moving targets. Burnt Fuzz is
generally considered the least dangerous anomaly in the Zone since it
can be easily spotted and avoided.*

Burnt Fuzz deals **1d6 points of damage** to rapidly moving targets.
It can be easily avoided by slowly moving past it. Burnt Fuzz is the
only anomaly that doesn't react to bolts. It does not create any
artifacts.

## Radiation

*Pockets of ionizing radiation, or simply radiation for short (areas
where the ambient radiation count exceeds 50 mR per hour) can be found
all over the Zone. In the outside areas, radiation tends to be
dominant in wide, open spaces and on piles of scrap (such as the dirt
or scrap piles in Garbage. Also cars, tractors and anything
mechanical). Radiation in itself doesn't form artifacts.*

Areas affected by radiation vary greatly in size, shape, and in their
strength. But each give out noticeable RAD per minute or hour.

## Space Anomaly

*It is truly the ultimate result of the Zone's instability as now it
alters the very fabric of reality and distorts time and space,
seemingly creating miniature Wormholes, which 'teleport' the player
and anything thrown into it to another spot.*

Space Anomalies may either teleport anything thrown into them somewhere
else.

## Space Bubble

*Attention. We are stuck in an anomaly....can't get out......it's
like space is warped......which ever way we go...can't
move...equipment has gone off the rails....can see the outline of a
town on the horizon...our coordinates...51...10..3..1..2....Is anybody
out there...?* -- Unfortunate stalker trapped in a space bubble.

*Not much is known about this kind of anomaly, except that anything that
ventures into them is never to be seen again.*

The Space Bubble is a special variant of the [Space Anomaly](#space-anomaly),
in that it creates a discrete separate region of space-time, trapping all
who enter it. Navigating a Space Bubble is almost impossible, without the
help of a [Compass](../artifacts/#compass) artifact.

Known to produce the following artifacts: [Compass](../artifacts/#compass).

## Emission

*An emission or blowout is a sudden and powerful release of excess
energy from the centre of the Zone. During a blowout, the energy
floats from the center of the Zone to the outskirts in a circular
pattern, affecting the minds and bodies of the living. Emissions are
precluded by a stormy cloud front, lightning, thunder and the sky
turning red.*

Anyone trapped outside when an emission hits is killed instantly or
turned into a zombie. Only fortified shelter can protect against
emissions. A shelter needs to have thick walls and a solid roof
to protect against emissions. Stalkers have learned to fortify houses,
old train cars, caves or even car wrecks to be emission shelters.
