Mutants are animals or humans who have been warped by the Zone,
changing both their physical appearance and behavior, usually making
them more aggressive.

# Reading these entries

All mutants have basic attributes, skills, endurance and health as
outlined here. If you wish to add varience to endurance and health,
substract or add the results of **d6** dice to the appropriate values.

Creatures sometimes have an inherent **damage resistance** (DR) value
that protects them from all sorts of damage, except from radiation
damage. Radiation resistance is given as **RAD** in the table. Creatures
can live with radiation up to the given rad value without any adverse
side affects.

# Flesh

*Like many other living creatures, domestic pigs in The Zone underwent
serious mutations following the second Chernobyl disaster, affecting
genes responsible for their metabolism. This eventually caused the
animal's phenotype to change significantly.*

## Behaviour

Flesh are the least aggressive mutated animals within the zone. They
will not actively hunt or attack other mutants or stalkers, but will
defend themselves. They also always roam the Zone in small groups
and will protect the herd from threats. Flesh will also flee against
overwhelming odds, or if wounded.

# Blind Dog

*Several generations of the dog species have lived and died since the
catastrophe. Each was more affected by the Zone than the previous
one. Rapid mutation lead to a vast improvement in previously
peripheral abilities, frequently at the expense of primary ones. The
most notable biological change was the loss of sight, paired with an
uncanny development of smell. As it turned out, blind pups survived in
the Zone as well as normal ones, if not better. As a result, the
common dog quickly became extinct in the Zone, giving way to a new
breed – that of blind dogs. The animals instinctively identify and
avoid anomalies, radiation, and other invisible dangers that plague
the Zone. Like their wild ancestors – the wolves – blind dogs hunt in
packs. An encounter with a large group of these animals can be
dangerous even to an experienced and well-armed stalker.*

## Behaviour

A lone blind doge is a rare sight, as blind dogs always hunt in large
packs. They usually attempt to encircle their prey before launching
an attack. Just like any animal, a blind dog will flee if wounded, or
if several members of its pack have been killed.
