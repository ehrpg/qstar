# Character

Every player character, non-player character (NPC) and creature such as animals,
monsters or even robots, etc. fall under this category and are created using the
following rules.

## Stats

Primary stats are fixed values every character has. These stats are only
modified by fatal events while adventuring, or by taking damage

### Primary

Primary stats or abilities are used for a number of things:

* add a bonus to various checks,
* define how much damage the character can sustain,
* enable perks
* enable certain action, e.g. carrying heavy stuff requires a minimal strength
  value.

Every character has 12 points to spend between the four primary stats upon
creation. Each primary stat has the initial value of 0. Points can only be
added, not subtracted from the ability. Abilities can never be higher than 5.

Any ability score at 5 means that the character is almost superhuman in that
ability. An ability score at 0 means that the character is somehow impaired, and
an ability score at -5 means that the character is dead.

#### Might

Might represents the character's physical strength and resilience. The
damage of some weapons is derived from might.

#### Speed

Speed measures the character's reflexes and hand-eye coordination. Adds a bonus
to most weapon attacks.

#### Intelligence

Intelligence describes how well your character learns new things, and how well
he remembers already existing things.

#### Charisma

Charisma represents the character's physical attractiveness, force of personality
and his ability to lead. It is mostly used in social interactions between
characters and NPCs.

### Secondary

#### Influence

Influence is gained by making a name for yourself in the cosmos, i.e. by helping
people and factions. Influence is lost by harming and disappointing others.

#### Resources

Resources are looted from enemies, gained from adventuring and quests.

#### Time

Spare time represents the time a character can invest in downtime activities.

A character acummuluates spare time the course of time. A character gains more
spare in between adventures and longer periods of downtime during adventures.

#### Goods

Trading goods that are looted from enemies, gained from adventuring and quests,
and sold for profit.

## Experience

Experience is gained throughout a character's adventuring career. Noteable
achievements or story completions *may* provide a character with experience
points, usually 1.

Experience improves the maximum values of the secondary stats, not necessarily
making your character stronger, but making the character more resourceful and
adaptable.

## Race

Every creature has a race, or at least a type that groups similar creatures into
the same category, e.g. animals.

A race modifies:

* primary and secondary stats,
* adds perks or flaws,
* enables access to inherent abilities,
* and may add roleplaying circumstances.
