You play a character, and the GM manages non-player characters. Every character
is defined by a set of attributes. Attributes include stats, experience, race,
perks, flaws, skills etc.

## Stats

Stats, are split into three categories:

* **Primary** stats, which describe what a character can do,
* **Secondary** stats, which describe what means a character has to do something,
* and **Pools**, which describe the health and well-being of a character.

Primary stats are fixed and only changed due to fatal events or accomplishments.
Secondary stats are in essence another sort of currency and are subject to
frequent changes. XYZ are used for combat, environmental hazards, etc.

### Primary

Primary stats are mainly used to meet perk, flaw, equipment and upgrade
requirements.

Every character has 12 points to distribute between any of the four following
stats. The initial value of a stat is at 0, and can never be raised higher than
5, not even with bonuses from e.g. equipment. If a character somehow were to
drop to -5 in a primary stat, the character instantly dies.

Primary stats cannot be easily changed, so think before distributing primary
stat points.

#### Might

**USED**{.hf} to determine the character's strength and toughness.

#### Speed

**USED**{.hf} to determine the character's reflexes and speed.

#### Intelligence

**USED**{.hf} to determine the character's ability to remember and learn things.

#### Charisma

**USED**{.hf} to determine the character's ability to interact with others.

### Secondary

Every secondary stat has a maximum value, that can never be exceeded. All
exceeding points are lost. The maximum value is affected by perks, experience
and special equipment.

#### Loot

Loot is the easiest form of reward. One unit of loot is called a parcel. Four
parcels require one storage space (e.g. vessels). A character can carry his
might stat in parcels.

**GAINED**{.hf} by looting enemies, or as reward from adventures and quests.

**USED**{.hf} to sell for profits and acquiring resources.

**SELLING**{.hf} loot nets `500 Cr.` per parcel sold. Selling 4 parcels at once
nets an extra `500 Cr.` on top (resulting in `2 500 Cr.` total).

**BUYING**{.hf} loot usually implies some kind of trade run (quest type). Buying
loot this way costs `250 Cr.` per parcel. If no trade run is done, the parcel
costs `500 Cr.` instead.

**EXCHANGING**{.hf} loot for [resources](#resources) is done at an exchange rate
of 12 loot parcels per resource point.

#### Downtime

The maximum downtime any character can accumulate is 10. This maximum can never
be changed.

**GAINED**{.hf} while adventuring. A character gains more downtime in between
adventures and longer periods of downtime during adventures. Any character gains
1 downtime each session.

**USED**{.hf} to recuperate, craft, repair and upgrade items and vessels and to
improve a character.

#### Influence

**GAINED**{.hf} by making a name for yourself in the cosmos, i.e. by helping
people and factions. Influence is lost by harming and disappointing others.

**USED**{.hf} for accessing and buying items, vessels, meetings with high
ranking characters, etc. Actions may require influence to be spent.

#### Resources

**GAINED**{.hf} by looting enemies, or as reward from adventures and quests.

**USED**{.hf} to create, repair, upgrade and acquire equipment and vessels.

#### Research

**GAINED**{.hf} by researching in downtime, or as a reward from adventures and
quests.

**USED**{.hf} to unlock upgrades and equipment for characters and vessels. Also
can be used to unlock bleeding edge vessels.

**EXCHANGING**{.hf} research points for technology (see vessels) is done at an
exchange rate of 12 research points per technology point.

Upgrades and equipment require blueprints to be researched first (e.g.
experimental weapons). Spending research unlocks the blueprint for the whole
party. Afterwards, the upgrade or equipment can be acquired. Also, vessels, and
vessel ugprades and equipment require technology. Research can be exchanged for
technology.

!!! tip "Research applications"
    Research isn't limited to vessels. Finding a cure for a disease for example
    requires research points. Finding a way to administer the cure effectively
    may require technology points.

### Pools

#### Health

#### Endurance

## Experience

**GAINED**{.hf} by noticeable achievements and story completions.

**USED**{.hf} to improve the maximum value of secondary stats.

Every character starts with 0 experience points.

## Race

Every character has a race or category (e.g. animals, robots). A race modifies:

* primary and secondary stats,
* adds perks or flaws,
* enables access to inherent abilities,
* and may add roleplaying circumstances

## Perks & Flaws

Perks have a primary stat requirement that has to be met. If this requirement is
not met, the perk cannot be taken. If the perk was taken in the past, but the
primary stat drops below the requirement, you do not gain any benefits from the
perk, but still suffer penalties from it.
