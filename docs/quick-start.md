You play a character, and the GM manages non-player characters. Every character
is defined by a set of attributes:

## Stats

Stats are split into three categories:

* Abilities, which describe what acharacter can do,
* ABC, which describe what means a character has to do something,
* and XYZ, which describe the health and well-being of a character.

Abilities are fixed and only changed due to fatal events or accomplishments. ABC
are another sort of currency and are subject to frequent changes. XYZ are used
for combat, environmental hazards, etc.

### Primary

Every character has 12 points to distribute between any of the four following
stats. The initial value of a stat is at 0, and cannot be raised higher than 5.
If a character somehow were to drop to -5 in a primary ability, the character
instantly dies.

#### Might

**USED**{.hf} to increase the character's strength and toughness.

#### Speed

**USED**{.hf} to increase the character's reflexes and speed.

#### Intelligence

**USED**{.hf} to increase the character's ability to remember and learn things.

#### Charisma

**USED**{.hf} to increase the character's ability to interact with others.

### Secondary

Every secondary stat has a maximum value, that can never be exceeded. All
exceeding points are lost. The maximum value is affected by perks, experience
and special equipment.

#### Loot

Loot is the easiest form of reward. One unit of loot is called a parcel. Four
parcels require one storage space (e.g. vessels). A character can carry his
might stat in parcels.

**GAINED**{.hf} by looting enemies, or as reward from adventures and quests.

**USED**{.hf} to sell for profits and acquiring resources.

**SELLING**{.hf} loot nets `500 Cr.` per parcel sold. Selling 4 parcels at once
nets an extra `500 Cr.` on top (resulting in `2 500 Cr.` total).

**BUYING**{.hf} loot usually implies some kind of trade run (quest type). Buying
loot this way costs `250 Cr.` per parcel. If no trade run is done, the parcel
costs `500 Cr.` instead.

**EXCHANGING**{.hf} loot for [resources](#resources) is done at an exchange rate
of 12 loot parcels per resource point.

#### Downtime

The maximum downtime any character can accumulate is 10. This maximum can never
be changed.

**GAINED**{.hf} while adventuring. A character gains more downtime in between
adventures and longer periods of downtime during adventures. Any character gains
1 downtime each session.

**USED**{.hf} to recuperate, craft, repair and upgrade items and vessels and to
improve a character.

#### Influence

**GAINED**{.hf} by making a name for yourself in the cosmos, i.e. by helping
people and factions. Influence is lost by harming and disappointing others.

**USED**{.hf} for accessing and buying items, vessels, meetings with high
ranking characters, etc. Actions may require influence to be spent.

#### Resources

**GAINED**{.hf} by looting enemies, or as reward from adventures and quests.

**USED**{.hf} to create, repair, upgrade and acquire equipment and vessels.

#### Research

**GAINED**{.hf} by researching in downtime, or as a reward from adventures and
quests.

**USED**{.hf} to unlock upgrades and equipment for characters and vessels. Also
can be used to unlock bleeding edge vessels.

Upgrades and equipment require blueprints to be researched first (e.g.
experimental weapons). Spending research unlocks the blueprint for the whole
party. Afterwards, the upgrade or equipment can be acquired. Also, vessels, and
vessel ugprades and equipment require technology. Research can be exchanged for
technology.

### Experience

**GAINED**{.hf} by noticeable achievements and story completions.

**USED**{.hf} to improve the maximum value of secondary stats.

Every character starts with 0 experience points.

### Race

Every character has a race or category (e.g. animals, robots). A race modifies:

* primary and secondary stats,
* adds perks or flaws,
* enables access to inherent abilities,
* and may add roleplaying circumstances

### Pools

#### Health

#### Endurance
