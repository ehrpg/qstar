## Hazards

### Cold

### Disease

### Drowning

### Falling

Per 2 tiles (~3 meters, 10 feet) of falling the Damage you received is increased
by [1d10](#d10)+1. The maximum damage is [10d10](#d10)+10 at a falling distance
of 20 tiles.

You can roll an Athletics check, similar to [Dodging](/crisis#dodging), to treat
the fall 2 tiles less, or 4 tiles if the Athletics check was a critical success.

An armours [Physical][] DR does not block this kind of damage.

#### Jumping out a moving vehicle

Jumping out a moving vehicle is similar to falling. Per 10 km/h or 6 mp/h you
are considered to fall 2 tiles.

#### Terminal velocity

Sometimes the damage can be less, if for example the gravity is lower than
Earth's gravity. Othertimes, falling long enough distances can kill you outright
too.

### Heat

### Hunger

### Poison

### Radiation

### Sleep

### Thirst
