### Falling

Falling is like an Attack made against you. Per 2 tiles (~3 meters, 10 feet) of
falling the Attack receives 1d6+1. The maximum value for the Attack is 10d6+10.
Divide the final Attack by 4. This is the damage you receive.

You can roll an Athletics check, similar to [Dodging](/crisis#dodging), to avoid
some of the damage.

An armours [Physical][] DR does not block this kind of damage.
