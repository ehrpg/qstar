# Skills

Skills abstract your character's education, hobbies and fields of expertise.

## Skill Checks

Whenever it's uncertain if a character can do a certain action, or if the
outcome is affected by noticeable outside factors, the character has to roll a
skill check.

!!! summary "Skill checks"
    <div class="formula formula-top formula-bottom">
    <span data-bracket-bottom="base">3d6</span> ±
    <span data-bracket-top="modifier">primary stat</span> ±
    <span data-bracket-bottom="bonus">skill</span> ±
    <span data-bracket-top="circumstance">other bonuses</span>
    </div>

## Skill Ranks

All skills are untrained initially. Untrained skills impose a penalty on the
skill check or disable the skill check altogether. Trained skills add bonuses to
the skill check.

Upon character creation every character can train 5 skills for free.
Additionally, for each [Intelligence](#intelligence) point exceeding 0 you can
train another skill for free. This results in every character having 5 to 10
skills available to them.

A character has at least 5 and at most 10 trained skills. Negative
[Intelligence](#intelligence) doesn't change the amount of trained skills
available.

Training a skill requires the corresponding primary stat to be at least 1.

| Skill rank      | Requires primary stat | Skill bonus |
|-----------------|----------------------:|------------:|
| Untrained       |                     - |          -2 |
| Trained (+1)    |                     1 |          +1 |
| Trained +X      |                     X |          +X |

If you improved a skill, and the corresponding primary stat was to be reduced
below its requirement, you also lose the benefit of the skill being improved.

!!! example "Skill improvements and losing primary stat points"
    Jack has a [Speed](#speed) of 3 and *Acrobatics* improved to `+2`. He is
    heavily wounded in combat and temporarily has to reduce his [Speed](#speed)
    to 1. The level of improvement of his *Acrobatics* stays at `+2`, the bonus
    drops to `+1` however until his primary stat is high enough again. While the
    primary stat is temporarily lowered, he also cannot improve *Acrobatics* any
    further (to e.g. `+3`).

### Improving Skills

Skills can be improved, to a maximum of +5 (capped by maximum primary stat
value). Each skill improvement increases the primary stat requirement and skill
bonus by one. Improving a skill costs 2 [Downtime](#downtime) per skill bonus.

!!! example "Improving a skill"
    Jack has *Light weapons* trained (not improved yet), a [Speed](#speed) rank
    of 3, and wants to improve this skill to `+2`. Since his [Speed](#speed)
    rank is equal or higher than the new primary stat requirement of 2, he can
    do, provided he has enough resources: Upgrading this skill would cost him `4
    000` [Cr.](#credits), and 4 [Downtime](#downtime).

<div class="col-layout-end"></div>
<div class="col-layout-start"></div>

### Training new skills

If you have less trained skills than you are allowed to have, you can train new
skills. If you already have the maximum amount of trained skills you are allowed
to have, you can unlearn a trained one in order to gain a new one. Swapping any
trained skill for an untrained one, or learning a new one costs 2
[Downtime](#downtime).

## Skill competitions

Characters compete against each others using skills. Unless otherwise stated,
the same skill is used for both parties.

## Available Skills

Below is a list of possible skills, provided by the Q* RPG system. Note, that
skills in bold are usually associated - but not limited to - vessel operation.

!!! tip "Available skills"
    Like any other  RPG system, Q* provides the GM and player with a set of
    skills. Neither the system nor characters are limited to these skills: if
    you require different skills to suite your needs, then add them to your
    game.

[^Science]:
    Choose two fields instead of one when training this skill the first time.
    Improving any of these two fields also improves the other one you chose.
    Additional fields can be trained following normal skill learning rules.
