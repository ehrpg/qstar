# Skills

Whenever it's uncertain if a character can do a certain action, or if the
outcome is affected by noticeable outside factors, the character has to roll a
skill check.

!!! tip "Available skills"
    Like any other system, Q* provides the GM and player with a set of skills.
    Neither the system nor characters are limited to these skills: if you
    require different skills to suite your needs, then add them to your game.

## Skill Checks

### Skill Ranks

Every skill has a skill rank, initially being at **Untrained**. Untrained skills
impose a penalty on skill checks, or can't be used at all.

| Skill Rank | Bonus |
|------------|------:|
| Untrained  |    -2 |
| Trained    |    +1 |
| Proficient |    +2 |
| Skilled    |    +4 |
| Master     |    +6 |

Any character can only have a maximum of 3 master rank skill at any given time.
