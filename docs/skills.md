# Skills

Skills abstract your character's education, hobbies and fields of expertise.

## Skill Checks

Whenever it's uncertain if a character can do an action, or if the outcome is
effected by noticeable outside factors, the character has to roll a skill check.

## Skill Ranks

A character can only have skills at rank [Skill - Superb](/skills#skill-ranks)
up to his [Intelligence](/character#intelligence) ability modifier. If the
[Intelligence](/character#intelligence) is less than 0, the character can have
no rank [Skill - Superb](/skills#skill-ranks) skills.

| Skill Rank | Skill Modifier | Downtime cost |
|------------|---------------:|--------------:|
| Terrible   |             -3 |            -4 |
| Poor       |             -2 |            -2 |
| Mediocre   |             -1 |            -1 |
| Fair       |              0 |             0 |
| Good       |             +1 |             1 |
| Great      |             +2 |             2 |
| Superb     |             +3 |             4 |

### Skill Ranks and Ability Damage

Temporary [Intelligence](/character#intelligence) damage **does not** change the
maximum [Skill - Superb](/skills#skill-ranks) rank skills. Permanent
[Intelligence](/character#intelligence) damage **does** change those values.

A character can lose his benefits from skills if the ability requirement is not
met anymore. Only the skill bonus changes, the skill rank stays unchanged.

A skill that has reached [Skill - Fair](/skills#skill-ranks) always provides its
bonus, no matter the current ability value.

!!! example "Example"
    Jack has skilled [Athletics - Great](/skills#skill-ranks), and his ability
    is [Strength - Great](/character#abilities). He loses strength and his rank
    is reduced to [Strength - Fair](/character#abilities). His skill also drops
    to [Athletics - Fair](/skills#skill-ranks) temporarily until his strength is
    restored.

    If his [Strength - Fair](/character#abilities) was further reduced to
    [Strength - Poor](/character#abilities), he would still have his skill at
    [Athletics - Fair](/skills#skill-ranks).

## Skill competitions

Characters compete against each others using skills. Unless otherwise stated,
the same skill is used for both parties.

## Available Skills

Below is a list of possible skills, provided by the Q* RPG system. Note, that
skills in bold are usually associated - but not limited to - vessel operation.

!!! tip "Available [Skills](#skills)"
    Like any other RPG system, Q* provides the GM and player with a set of
    skills. Neither the system nor characters are limited to these skills: if
    you require different skills to suite your needs, then add them to your
    game. For balancing reasons try to restrict yourself to only 4 available
    skills per ability.
