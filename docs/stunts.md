# Stunts

Stunts are actions that can only be used provided you qualify for a stunt,
usually by rolling a **6**{.qs-d6} on a check. Some stunts can only be used once
per check, while other stunts may require multiple **6**{.qs-d6} to be rolled on
a single check.

If a stunt doesn't specify the amount of uses and amount of **6**{.qs-d6} to be
rolled, the stunt can only be used once per check and requires a single
**6**{.qs-d6}.

## Legendary stunts & fumbles

Whenever someone rolls three *sixes*{.qstar-3sixes} on a check the action is
considered a legendary stunt. Three *ones*{.qstar-3ones} are considered an
fumble. People in the RPG's cosmos will talk about this. They may not know the
nature of the legend or fumble, but they will have heard about it (provided that
they **can** hear about it sometime).

Legendary stunts **always** succeed, no matter the result. In addition, a player
can describe some course of action that becomes a legend.

Fumbles **always** fail, no matter the result. The GM can describe how the
check fails.

These stunts and fails have a chance of `0.4%` so they justify the use of over
the top actions, although they cannot break physics or realism.

!!! danger "The use of legendary stunts & fumbles"
    Legendary stunts & fumbles should never break quests or adventures, etc.
    A fumble doesn't kill the player character, nor does a legendary stunt
    complete a quest (e.g. you can't blow up a death star with a single
    legendary action).

    Legendary stunts should make things a bit easier, if at all, but most of all
    provide a memorable event for both the players and the GM.

    Fumbles should provide the possibility to creatively solve new problems
    and circumstances. E.g. the example above might result in the party being
    imprisoned by the enemy, and they have to work for them or escape a prison.

## Available Stunts

Below is a list of possible stunts, provided by the Q* RPG system.

!!! tip "Available Stunts"
    Like any other RPG system, Q* provides the GM and player with a set of
    stunts. Neither the system nor characters are limited to these stunts: if
    you require different stunts to suite your needs, then add them to your
    game.

    Also, players are very welcome to come up with their own stunts, if the
    available stunts to not suffice. After all, creativity should be awarded!
