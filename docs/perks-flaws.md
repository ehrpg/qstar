# Perks & Flaws

## Perks

Perks unlock abilities, improve stats or change roleplayining circumstances in a
positive way.

While perks state their costs, your GM can require additional things before you
can *buy* a perk, i.e. you first have to:

* find someone who can train you,
* make acquiantances with important NPCs,
* use skills related to the perk,
* etc.

Also, if the perk is not reasonable at all for your character, the perk simply
isn't available to you.

    Like any other  RPG system, Q* provides the GM and player with a set of
    perks. Neither the system nor characters are limited to these perks: if
    you require different perks to suite your needs, then add them to your
    game.

next to the skill name determine how many sixes have to be rolled to use the

## Flaws

Flaws outline behavior, add quirks or weaknesses to your character or change
roleplaying circumstances in a negative way.

<!-- TODO add flaw additional requirements text -->

Also, if the flaw is not reasonable at all for your character, the flaw simply
isn't available to you.

Flaws can **never** be removed. If you don't play your weaknesses, you shouldn't
pick the flaw in the first place, e.g. when playing a character with the
introvert flaw like an extrovert person.
