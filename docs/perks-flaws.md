# Perks & Flaws

## Perks

Perks unlock abilities, improve stats or change roleplayining circumstances in a
positive way.

While perks state their costs, your GM can require additional things before you
can *buy* a perk, i.e. you first have to:

* find someone who can train you,
* make acquiantances with important NPCs,
* use skills related to the perk,
* etc.

Also, if the perk is not reasonable at all for your character, the perk simply
isn't available to you.

### Available Perks

Below is a list of possible perks, provided by the Q* RPG system. Note, that
perks in bold are usually associated - but not limited to - vessel operation.

!!! tip "Available perks"
    Like any other  RPG system, Q* provides the GM and player with a set of
    perks. Neither the system nor characters are limited to these perks: if
    you require different perks to suite your needs, then add them to your
    game.
