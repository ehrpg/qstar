# Flaws

Flaws outline behavior, add quirks or weaknesses to your character or change
roleplaying circumstances in a negative way.

<!-- TODO add flaw additional requirements text -->

Also, if the flaw is not reasonable at all for your character, the flaw simply
isn't available to you.

Some flaws can be removed, but that usually requires a lot of hard work. A GM
may even build an adventure around the flaw removal.

Below is a list of flaws, provided by the Q* RPG system.

!!! info "Available flaws"
    Like any other RPG system, Q* provides the GM and player with a set of
    flaws. Neither the system nor characters are limited to these flaws: if
    you require different flaws to suite your needs, then add them to your
    game.
