# Flaws

Flaws outline behavior, add quirks or weaknesses to your character or change
roleplaying circumstances in a negative way.

<!-- TODO add flaw additional requirements text -->

Also, if the flaw is not reasonable at all for your character, the flaw simply
isn't available to you.

Some flaws can be removed, but that usually requires a lot of hard work. A GM
may even build an adventure around the flaw removal.

## Requirements

Flaws are usually restricted by Attribute ranks, Skill ranks, or other stats.
Races or GM decisions providing flaws ignore the requirement.

If a flaw states an Attribute rank or Skill rank requirement, the character may not
exceed that rank. Also a flaw's requirement prohibits a character to improve the
Attribute or Skill above the requirement.

Below is a list of possible flaws, provided by the Q* RPG system.

!!! info "Available flaws"
    Like any other  RPG system, Q* provides the GM and player with a set of
    flaws. Neither the system nor characters are limited to these flaws: if
    you require different flaws to suite your needs, then add them to your
    game.
