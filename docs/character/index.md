# Character

Every player character, non-player character (NPC) and creature such as animals,
monsters or even robots, etc. fall under this category and are created using the
following rules.

A character is defined by:

* A race,
* abilities,
* Means,
* experience,
* pools, and
* traits, such as perks and flaws.

## Race

See [Races](/character/races).

## Abilities

Abilities are *mostly fixed* values every creature has. They are only modified
by *certain events* while adventuring, or by improvements using
[Downtime](/character#downtime-dt) and [Credits](/equipment#credits-cr).

Every character starts with all four abilities on Rank 10. Upon character
creation, this rank can be adjusted following the character improvement rules.

Improving an ability by 1 Rank costs 6 [Downtime](/character#downtime-dt).
Decreasing an ability can only be done at character creation at nets 6
[Downtime](/character#downtime-dt) per Rank decreased.

|   Rank | Downtime cost |
|-------:|--------------:|
|    ... |           ... |
|      8 |           -12 |
|      9 |            -6 |
| **10** |         **-** |
|     11 |             6 |
|     12 |            12 |
|    ... |           ... |

### Might (MI)

> Might represents the character's physical strength and resilience.

The damage of melee weapons is derived from might. Also improves a character's
toughness.

</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">

### Speed (SP)

> Speed measures the character's reflexes and eye-hand coordination.

Speed adds a bonus to ranged weaopn attacks, is used for stealth and lets you
act in a [Crisis](/#crisis) sooner.

</div>
<div class="left" markdown="1">

### Intelligence (IN)

> Intelligence describes how well your character learns new things, and how well
he remembers already existing things.

Intelligence improves a character's ability to assess situations and skills
related to knowing things.

</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">

### Charisma (CH)

> Charisma represents the character's physical attractiveness, force of personality
and his ability to lead.

Charisma is mostly used in social interactions between characters and NPCs.

## Secondary Characteristics

### Initiative

A character's Initiative is determined by adding [Speed](/character#speed) and
[Intelligence](/character#intelligence) together, and then device the result by
4.

      (<span data-bracket-bottom="Speed">SP</span> +
      <span data-bracket-top="Might">MI</span>)
      <span data-bracket-bottom="Base">x0.25</span>
    </div>

### Perception

Perception is a passive value that represents the character's alertness. It's
used to counter creatures that used the [Stealth
Skill](/character/skills#stealth), etc.

!!! summary "Perception"
    <div class="formula formula-top formula-bottom">
        <span data-bracket-bottom="Base">10</span> +
        <span data-bracket-top="Level">LVL</span> +
        <span data-bracket-bottom="Perks / Flaws / Race">Circumstance</span>
    </div>

### Pools

> Each creature has [Health](/character/#health-hp) and
> [Endurance](/character/#endurance-ep) pools. A robot is defined as a
> character, but instead of [Health](/character/#health-hp) and
> [Endurance](/character/#endurance-ep) has the pools
> [Integrity](/character/#health-hp) and [Power](/character/#endurance-ep),
> acting just the same.

[Endurance](/character/#endurance-ep) serves as an easily replenishable pool that's
usually targetted by damage first. Once depleted, the health pool is targetted.
[Health](/character/#health-hp) is very hard to replenish.

<div class="left" markdown="1">

#### Health (HP)

> [Health](/character/#health-hp) represents the character's overall condition.

If [Health](/character/#health-hp) drops to zero or below, the character is
*dying*. A *dying* character has to make a [Might](/character#might) check the
first time he drops to or below zero, and every time he receives damage while in
a *dying* state. On a failed check the character falls unconcious. If the check
succeeds, the character retains conciousnes.

Outside of combat, a *dying* character loses one HP per minute, until he
receives medical attention.

A character that drops to or below his HP in negative dies.

        <span data-bracket-top="Perks / Flaws / Race">Circumstance</span>
    </div>

</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">

#### Endurance (EP)

> [Endurance](/character/#endurance-ep) represents the character's resilience.

Damage from weapons, other characters, environments and certain actions such as
sprinting cause stress on a character and reduce his
[Endurance](/character/#endurance-ep).

!!! summary "Maximum [Endurance](/character/#endurance-ep)"
    <div class="formula formula-top formula-bottom">
        <span data-bracket-bottom="Ability Rank">Might</span>

        <span data-bracket-bottom="Perks / Flaws / Race">Circumstance</span>
    </div>

</div>
<div class="clearfix"></div>

### Experience (XP)

> Experience is gained throughout a character's adventuring career.

Experience (XP) is gained due to noteable achievements or story completions. XP
usually is only given out one at a time. The GM can decide to give out more for
completing a longer adventure.

<blockquote class="important" markdown="1">
Every character has 0 XP upon creation.
</blockquote>

Every three Experience Points (XP) increase a character's level by one.

#### Level (LVL)

A character's level improves the maximum values of his currencies. This does not
necessarily make the character stronger, but make the character more resourceful
and adaptable.

### Fate

> A character can change the course of action and his fate.

Every character has the same amount of fate rolls available as he has
[Experience](/character#experience-xp). A fate roll allows a character to
*re-roll* the entire check (all 3d6). Using a fate roll consumes one
[Experience](/character#experience-xp). Using fate can reduce a character's
level. Fate cannot be used if you have zero
[Experience](/character#experience-xp) Points.

Fate helps powerful characters to get a better outcome when faced with dire
consequences, but changing fate always comes with a cost.

### Means

> Means abstract the resources available to a character.

Means are limited by a maximum value, and are used to improve your character.
This maximum value is modified by Circumstances, [Perks](/perks), and
permanently due to [Experience](#experience-xp).

The current value for Means can **never** exceed the maximum value. All
exceeding points are usually lost.

[Influence](/character#influence-inf), [Resources](/character#resources-res) and
[Technology](/character#technology-tech) can be traded for each other. Any two
Means of one sort can be traded in for any other.
[Downtime](/character#downtime-dt) cannot be traded.

!!! tip "Buying Means"
    A GM may disallow exchanging [Credits](/equipment#credits-cr) for Means
    directly. Instead, he may require a character or the party to go on a quest
    or adventure in order to exchange [Credits](/equipment#credits-cr). E.g. the
    party has to find a wealthy trader, or rescue a trader from pirates first,
    etc.

### Downtime (DT)

> [Downtime](#downtime-dt) represents the time a character can invest in
> [Downtime](#downtime-dt) activities.

**GAINED**{.hf} over the course of time. A character gains more
[Downtime](#downtime-dt) in between adventures and longer periods of downtime
during adventures. A character gains at least 1 [Downtime](#downtime-dt) each
session automatically.

**USED**{.hf} to recuperate, craft, repair and upgrade items and vessels and to
improve a character.

Actions that take longer, like repairing a damaged vessel consume
[Downtime](#downtime-dt). Usually, a task that consumes [Downtime](#downtime-dt)
has at least a DC of 12. Better skill checks can reduce [Downtime](#downtime-dt)
and/or [Resources](/character/#resources-res)  used, while bad skill checks can
increase [Downtime](#downtime-dt) and/or [Resources](/character/#resources-res)
used. This DC *may* be lowered or increased depending on the situation.

<div class="right" markdown="1">

### Influence (INF)

> [Influence](#influence-inf) represents connections, owed favours by others,
> fame and infamy.

**GAINED**{.hf} by making a name for yourself in the cosmos, i.e. by helping
people and factions. [Influence](#influence-inf) is lost by harming and
disappointing others.

**USED**{.hf} for accessing and buying items, vessels, meetings with high
ranking characters, etc.

More [Influence](#influence-inf) unlocks better equipment and better vessels.
Traders may also give you better prices.

<div class="left" markdown="1">

### Resources (RES)

> [Resources](#resources-res) represent materials used for creating, repairing,
> upgrading and acquiring equipment.

**GAINED**{.hf} by looting, or completing missions, adventures and quests.

**USED**{.hf} to create, repair, upgrade and acquire equipment and vessels.

[Resources](#resources-res) can be used to repair vessels, in which case the
[Resources](#resources-res) are spent on the repair.

If [Resources](#resources-res) are spent on equipment, your maximum
[Resources](#resources-res) are *temporarily lowered* by that amount. This
abstracts the upkeep of a powerful item.

Powerful equipment requiring [Resources](#resources-res) usually adds
[stunts](/stunts) or other benefits.

    </div>

</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">

### Technology (TECH)

> [Technology](#technology-tech) represents the character's technological
> knowledge, which on the other hand allows to unlock new
> [Equipment](/character/equipment).

**GAINED**{.hf} by aiding science missions, acquiring blueprints, spending time
on researching certain scientific fields, etc.

**USED**{.hf} for unlocking experimental equipment and vessels. Once unlocked,
the experimental equipment or vessel can be acquired.

Certain ugprades require [Technology](#technology-tech) in order to be unlocked.
Upgrades have to be unlocked only once, and *can* be shared between characters.
Unlocking upgrades enables the acquisition of better equipment and vessels.

## Skills

See [Skills](/character/skills/).

## Perks

See [Perks](/character/perks/).

## Flaws

See [Flaws](/character/flaws/).

## Improving your character

Improving your character happens automatically due completing missions, quests,
fighting and adventuring and eventually earning [Experience](#experience-xp),
which will increase the character's [Level](#level-lvl).

[Abilities](/character#abilities) and [Skills](/character/skills#skills) can be
improved too, but require [Downtime](/character#downtime) which in general is
hard to come by.

Any characters skills and expertise are greatly enhanced by the equipment they
own. Hard training may give a character a permanent bonus, but the right item is
often cheaper and acquired more easily.
