# Skills

> Skills abstract your character's education, hobbies and fields of expertise.

Every character starts with each [Skill](#skills) at a [d4](#d4). The exception
here are [Trained-only Skills](#trained-only-skills) that only can be used if
they are trained.

Upgrading a [Skill](#skills) allows the character to use a [d6](#d6), a
[d8](#d8), a [d10](#d10) or a [d12](#d12).

You cannot raise a Skill above a [d12](#d12).

Everything a character does is usually associated with a [Skill](#skills),
whereas every [Skill](#skills) has an Attribute it's
associated with.

## Trained-only Skills

Some [Skills](#skills) can only be used if you trained them by spending one
skill point on them. Only then can you roll a [d4](#d4) on these Skills.
Improving a Trained-only Skill works the same as with normal Skills.

Trained-only Skills are indicated by a **"*"** next
to their name.

## Task roll

> Whenever it's uncertain if a character can do an action, or if the outcome is
effected by noticeable outside factors, the character has to roll a **Task**
roll.

A **Task** roll is made by rolling the [Skill's](#skills) respective die and
adding bonuses and penalties to the roll. If no Skill applies, or the Skill
isn't available to the character, the GM can decide that an Attribute roll also
works in place of a Task roll.

## Skill competitions

Characters compete against each others using skills. Unless otherwise stated,
the same skill is used for both parties.

Both parties make a Task roll. The party with the higher result wins. On a tie,
roll again.

## Available Skills

Below is a list of possible skills, provided by the Q* RPG system.

!!! info "Available [Skills](#skills)"
    Like any other RPG system, Q* provides the GM and player with a set of
    Skills. Neither the system nor characters are
    limited to these Skills: if you require
    different Skills to suite your needs, then add
    them to your game. For balancing reasons try to restrict yourself to only 4
    available Skills per
    Attribute.
