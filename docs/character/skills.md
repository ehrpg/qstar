# Skills

> Skills abstract your character's education, hobbies and fields of expertise.

Everything a character does is usually associated with a
[Skill](/character/skills#skills). A Skill further modifies the roll a character
has to make in order to succeed or fail. Every Skill has an
[Attribute](/character#attributes) it's associated with.

A character can only have Skills at rank [Skill -
Superb](/character/skills/#skills) up to the associated
[Attribute](/character#attributes) Modifier. If the [Attribute](/character#attributes)
Modifier is less than 0, the character can have no rank [Skill -
Superb](/character/skills/#skills) Skills associated with this
[Attribute](/character#attributes).

|    # | Rank     | Modifier | Easy | Average | Hard |
|-----:|----------|---------:|-----:|--------:|-----:|
|    0 | Terrible |       -6 |    - |       - |    - |
|    1 | Poor     |       -3 |    - |       - |    1 |
|    2 | Mediocre |       -1 |    - |       1 |    2 |
|    3 | Fair     |        0 |    1 |       2 |    4 |
|    4 | Good     |       +1 |    2 |       4 |    8 |
|    5 | Great    |       +3 |    4 |       8 |   12 |
|    6 | Superb   |       +6 |    8 |      12 |   16 |

## Skill difficulty

A Skill is either easy, average or hard to master, as indicated by each
individual Skill. More difficult Skills require more investment of time and
money to improve, while easier Skills require less.

### Skill defaults

A Skill usually can be used even without any investments into the Skill, unless
otherwise noted by the Skill itself. These are the defaults for
[Skills](/character/skills#skills):

* Easy Skills can be used as a Skill at Rank [Skill -
  Mediocre](/character/skills#skills).
* Average Skills can be used as a Skill at Rank [Skill -
  Poor](/character/skills#skills).
* Hard Skills can be used as a Skill at Rank [Skill -
  Terrible](/character/skills#skills).

If a [Skill*](/character/skills#skills) has an asterisk next to it, it cannot be
used without any investments.


## Skill Checks

Whenever it's uncertain if a character can do an action, or if the outcome is
effected by noticeable outside factors, the character has to roll a skill check.

!!! summary "Skill checks"
    <div class="formula formula-top formula-bottom">
        <span data-bracket-bottom="Base">3d6</span> ±
        <span data-bracket-top="Attribute Modifier">Attribute</span> ±
        <span data-bracket-bottom="Skill Modifier">Skill</span> ±
        <span data-bracket-top="Perks / Flaws / Race">Circumstance</span>
    </div>

</blockquote>

### Skill difficulty

Skill checks have to be equal or higher to the **Target #** specified by its
[Difficulty](/crisis#difficulty), in order to succeed.

### Skill Ranks and Attribute Damage

Temporary [Attribute](/character#attributes) damage **does not** change the maximum
[Skill - Superb](/character/skills/#skills) rank skills. Permanent
[Attribute](/character#attributes) damage **does** change those values.

A character can lose his benefits from skills if the Attribute requirement is not
met anymore. Only the skill bonus changes, the skill rank stays unchanged.


!!! example "Example"
    Jack has skilled [Athletics - Great](/character/skills/#skills), and his
    Attribute is [Might - Great](/character/#might-mi). He loses
    [Might](/character#might-mi) and his rank is reduced to [Might -
    Fair](/character/#might-mi). His skill also drops to [Athletics -
    Fair](/character/skills/#skills) temporarily until his
    [Might](/character#might-mi) is restored.

## Skill competitions

Characters compete against each others using skills. Unless otherwise stated,
the same skill is used for both parties.

## Available Skills

Below is a list of possible skills, provided by the Q* RPG system.

!!! info "Available [Skills](#skills)"
    Like any other RPG system, Q* provides the GM and player with a set of
    skills. Neither the system nor characters are limited to these skills: if
    you require different skills to suite your needs, then add them to your
    game. For balancing reasons try to restrict yourself to only 4 available
    skills per Attribute.
