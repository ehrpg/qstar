# Skills

> Skills abstract your character's education, hobbies and fields of expertise.

Everything a character does usually requires a skill. A skill further modifies
the roll a character has to make in order to succeed or fail. Every skill has an
[Ability](/character#abilities) it's associated with.

| Skill Rank                         | Easy | Average | Hard |
|------------------------------------|-----:|--------:|-----:|
| [Ability](/character#abilities) -3 |    - |       - |    1 |
| [Ability](/character#abilities) -2 |    - |       1 |    2 |
| [Ability](/character#abilities) -1 |    1 |       2 |    4 |
| [Ability](/character#abilities) +0 |    2 |       4 |    8 |
| [Ability](/character#abilities) +1 |    4 |       8 |   12 |
| [Ability](/character#abilities) +2 |    8 |      12 |   16 |
| [Ability](/character#abilities) +3 |   12 |      16 |   20 |
| Extra +1                           |   +4 |      +4 |   +4 |

Skills can be improved further and do not cap at a `+3` bonus. The cost of each
additional Rank beyond the `+3` bonus is indicated by the *Extra + 1* columns.

## Skill difficulty

A Skill is either easy, average or hard to master, as indicated by each
individual Skill. More difficult Skills require more investment of time and
money to improve, while easier Skills require less.

### Skill defaults

A Skill usually can be used even if it's not trained, unless otherwise noted by
the Skill itself. An easy Skill imposes a -4 penalty, an average Skill a -5
penalty and a hard Skill a -6 penalty. Skills that don't have a default level
cannot be used without training.

## Skill Checks

Whenever it's uncertain if a character can do an action, or if the outcome is
effected by noticeable outside factors, the character has to roll a skill check.

### Ability checks

Some tasks are too general for a [Skill](/character/skills#skills) to apply. If
that's the case, simply roll against your [Ability](/character#abilities) Rank
and Circumstance Modifiers.

## Skill competitions

Characters compete against each others using skills. Unless otherwise stated,
the same skill is used for both parties.

Each party in a competition has to roll on its Skill. If only one party succeeds
on the check, it also succeeds on the competition. If both parties succeed, the
one with the largest margin of success wins. If both parties fail, the one with
the smallest margin of failure wins. In a tie nobody wins.

## Available Skills

Below is a list of possible skills, provided by the Q* RPG system.

!!! info "Available [Skills](#skills)"
    Like any other RPG system, Q* provides the GM and player with a set of
    skills. Neither the system nor characters are limited to these skills: if
    you require different skills to suite your needs, then add them to your
    game. For balancing reasons try to restrict yourself to only 4 available
    skills per ability.
