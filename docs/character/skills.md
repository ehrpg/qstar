# Skills

> Skills abstract your character's education, hobbies and fields of expertise.

Every [Skill](#skills) is initially untrained. [Trained-only
Skills](#trained-only-skills) can only be used if they are trained first.

## Skill ranks

A Skill has one of the 5 following ranks:

<div class="qs-list-test full-width" markdown="1">

##### Untrained

Untrained Skills suffer a -2 penalty. Some Skills cannot be used if they are
untrained.

##### Trained

Trained Skills neither provide a bonus nor suffer a penalty to Skill rolls.

##### Skilled

Skilled Skills receive a +1 bonus to Skill rolls.

##### Expert

Expert Skills receive a +2 bonus to Skill rolls.

##### Master

Master Skills receive a +3 bonus to Skill rolls.

</div>

### Trained-only Skills

Some [Skills](#skills) can only be used if you trained them by spending one
skill point on them. Improving a trained-only [skills](#skills) works the same
as with normal [Skills](#skills).

Trained-only [Skills](#skills) are indicated by a **"*"** next to their name.

## Skill roll

> Whenever it's uncertain if a character can do an action, or if the outcome is
effected by noticeable outside factors, the character has to roll a
[Skill](#skills) roll.

A [Skill](#skills) roll is made by rolling [3d6](#3d6) and adding the
[Skills](#skills)'s respective bonuses and penalties to the roll.

If no [Skill](#skills) applies, or the [Skill](#skills) isn't available to the
character, the GM can decide that you can also make a generic, *untrained*
[Skill](#skills) roll.

!!! summary "[Skill](#skills) roll"
    <div class="formula formula-top formula-bottom">
        <span data-bracket-bottom="Base Dice">3d6</span> ±
        <span data-bracket-top="Associated Attr.">Attribute / 3</span> ±
        <span data-bracket-bottom="Bonuses and Penalties">Skill</span>
    </div>

A Skill roll can further be influenced by Assets and Circumstance like heavy
rain, help from allies, etc.

### Task Difficulty

A task's [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty) defines the minimum requirement
for a **Skill** roll to be successful.

A check has to be equal to or higher this [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty)
in order to succeed. Otherwise, the check fails.

!!! danger "Task Difficulties"
    Routine or Easy: 8 or more.<br>
    Moderate task: 12 or more.<br>
    Difficult task: 16 or more.<br>
    Very Difficult task: 18 or more.

!!! info "Check Failures"
    A failed check doesn't necessarily mean, that the check completely failed.
    E.g. when climbing, a failed check might simply mean, that there was no
    progress while climbing. Or a failed sailing check might mean, that the
    voyage takes a few days longer.

## Skill competitions

Characters compete against each others using skills. Unless otherwise stated,
the same skill is used for both parties.

Both parties make a **Skill** roll. The party with the higher result wins. On a
tie, the better trained character wins. If the Skills are on the same level,
roll again.

## Available Skills

Below is a list of possible skills, provided by the Q* RPG system.

!!! info "Available [Skills](#skills)"
    Like any other RPG system, Q* provides the GM and player with a set of
    Skills. Neither the system nor characters are limited to these Skills: if
    you require different Skills to suite your needs, then add them to your
    game. For balancing reasons try to restrict yourself to only 4 available
    Skills per Attribute.

!!! info "Trained-only Skills"
    Some Skills are trained-only or not trained-only based on available media
    and common knowledge of the digital age.
