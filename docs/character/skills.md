# Skills

> Skills abstract your character's education, hobbies and fields of expertise.

A character can only have skills at rank [Skill -
Superb](/character/skills/#skills) up to his
[Intelligence](/character/#intelligence) ability modifier. If the
[Intelligence](/character/#intelligence) is less than 0, the character can have
no rank [Skill - Superb](/character/skills/#skills) skills.

## Skill Checks

Whenever it's uncertain if a character can do an action, or if the outcome is
effected by noticeable outside factors, the character has to roll a skill check.

### Skill Ranks and Ability Damage

Temporary [Intelligence](/character/#intelligence) damage **does not** change
the maximum [Skill - Superb](/character/skills/#skills) rank skills. Permanent
[Intelligence](/character/#intelligence) damage **does** change those values.

A character can lose his benefits from skills if the ability requirement is not
met anymore. Only the skill bonus changes, the skill rank stays unchanged.


!!! example "Example"
    Jack has skilled [Athletics - Great](/character/skills/#skills), and his
    ability is [Might - Great](/character/#might). He loses
    [Might](/character#might) and his rank is reduced to [Might -
    Fair](/character/#might). His skill also drops to [Athletics -
    Fair](/character/skills/#skills) temporarily until his
    [Might](/character#might) is restored.

## Skill competitions

Characters compete against each others using skills. Unless otherwise stated,
the same skill is used for both parties.

## Available Skills

Below is a list of possible skills, provided by the Q* RPG system.

!!! info "Available [Skills](#skills)"
    Like any other RPG system, Q* provides the GM and player with a set of
    skills. Neither the system nor characters are limited to these skills: if
    you require different skills to suite your needs, then add them to your
    game. For balancing reasons try to restrict yourself to only 4 available
    skills per ability.
