# Skills

> [Skills][] abstract your character's education, hobbies and fields of expertise.

Every character is defined by the following three categories of [Skills][].
While a character can have virtually *any* [Skill][], the categories list the
most common ones.

A Skill roll has to be equal to or higher than a **4** in order to succeed.
Skill rolls lower than a **4** fail. The GM can give your role a bonus or
penalty depending on circumstances.

A [Skill][] that is at a [d4](#d4) is considered **untrained**. Some [Skills][]
should only be usable if they are trained, indicated by a **"*"** next to their
name. These [Skills][] can still be used if untrained, but only for very basic
things.

Every 8 Character Points used in a single category improves the category's
bonus by one. If you make a Skill check you add the corresponding category's
bonus to the roll:

!!! example "Skill categories and Skills"
    A character has two [Action][] Skills at a [d12](#d12). The cost of
    improving those [Skills][] to a [d12](#d12) is 8 Character Points. The
    character's bonus on [Action][] Skills is therefor 1. If he now makes an
    [Action][] Skill roll, he adds the bnus to the roll:<br>
