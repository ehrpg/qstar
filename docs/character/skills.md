# Skills

> [Skills][] abstract your character's education, hobbies and fields of expertise.

Every skill is initially untrained. [Trained-only Skills][] can only be used if
they are trained first.

Improving a skill by one rank costs 1 Skill Point. The first rank, from
untrained to trained, costs 2 Skill Points.

## Skill ranks

A skill has one of the 5 following ranks:

<div class="qs-list-test full-width" markdown="1">

##### Untrained

Untrained [Skills][] suffer a -2 penalty. Some [Skills][] cannot be used if they
are untrained.

##### Trained

Trained [Skills][] neither provide a bonus nor suffer a penalty to Skill rolls.

##### Skilled

Skilled [Skills][] receive a +1 bonus to Skill rolls.

##### Expert

Expert [Skills][] receive a +2 bonus to Skill rolls.

##### Master

Master [Skills][] receive a +3 bonus to Skill rolls.

</div>

### Trained-only Skills

Some [Skills][] can only be used if you trained them first. Improving a
trained-only skill works the same as with normal [Skills][].

[Trained-only Skills][] are indicated by a **"*"** next to their name.

## Skill rolls

> Whenever it's uncertain if a character can do an action, or if the outcome is
effected by noticeable outside factors, the character has to make a skill roll.

A skill roll is made by rolling [3d6](#3d6) and adding the [Skills][]'s
respective bonuses and penalties to the roll.

If no skill applies for a specific task, or the skill isn't available to the
character, the GM can decide that the player can also make a generic,
*untrained* skill roll.

A Skill roll can further be influenced by Assets and Circumstance like heavy
rain, help from allies, etc.

### Task Difficulty

A task's [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty) defines the minimum requirement
for a skill roll to be successful.

A check has to be equal to or higher this [Difficulty Level](/crisis#difficulty)
in order to succeed. Otherwise, the check fails.

!!! danger "Task Difficulties"
    Routine or Easy: 8 or more.<br>
    Moderate task: 12 or more.<br>
    Difficult task: 16 or more.<br>
    Very Difficult task: 18 or more.

!!! info "Check Failures"
    A failed check doesn't necessarily mean, that the check completely failed.
    E.g. when climbing, a failed check might simply mean, that there was no
    progress while climbing. Or a failed sailing check might mean, that the
    voyage takes a few days longer.

## Skill competitions

Characters compete against each others using [Skills][]. Unless otherwise
stated, the same skill is used for both parties.

Both parties make a skill roll. The party with the higher result wins. On a tie,
the better trained character wins. If the [Skills][] are on the same level, roll
again.

## Available Skills

Below is a list of possible [Skills][], provided by the Q* RPG system.

!!! info "Available [Skills][]"
    Like any other RPG system, Q* provides the GM and player with a set of
    [Skills][]. Neither the system nor characters are limited to these
    [Skills][]: if you require different [Skills][] to suite your needs, then
    add them to your game. For balancing reasons try to restrict yourself to
    only 4 available [Skills][] per Attribute.

!!! tip "[GM Tip] [Trained-only Skills][]"
    Some [Skills][] are trained-only or not trained-only based on available
    media and common knowledge of the digital age. Depending on your setting you
    can adjust if a skill is trained-only by your best knowledge.
