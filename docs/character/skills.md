> Skills abstract your character's education, hobbies and fields of expertise.

</div>

Every character starts with each [Skill](/character/skills#skills) at a d4.
Upgrading a [Skill](/character/skills#skills) allows the character to use a d6,
a d8, a d10 or a d12. Upgrading a [Skill](/character/skills#skills) beyond a d12
adds a flat bonus of +1 per upgrade to the check. A
[Skill](/character/skills#skills) cannot be improved to a die higher than it's
corresponding [Attribute](/character#attributes).

Everything a character does is usually associated with a
[Skill](/character/skills#skills), whereas every
[Skill](/character/skills#skills) has an [Attribute](/character#attributes) it's
associated with.

Upgrading a [Skill](/character/skills#skills) by one step costs
[Downtime](/character#downtime-dt), depending on the
[Skill](/character/skills#skills)'s difficulty.

Downgrading only happens due to *fatal* adventuring events.

## Skill Difficulty

A [Skill](/character/skills#skills) is either easy, average or hard to master,
as indicated by each individual [Skill](/character/skills#skills). More
difficult Skills require more investment of time and money to improve, while
easier Skills require less.

An easy [Skill](/character/skills#skills) costs 2
[Downtime](/character#downtime-dt) to improve. A medium
[Skill](/character/skills#skills) costs 4 [Downtime](/character#downtime-dt) to
improve. a hard [Skill](/character/skills#skills) costs 6
[Downtime](/character#downtime-dt) to improve.

## Skill Checks

Whenever it's uncertain if a character can do an action, or if the outcome is
effected by noticeable outside factors, the character has to roll a skill check.

### Skills and Attribute Damage

Temporary [Attribute](/character#attributes) damage **does not** incure any
penalties. Permanent [Attribute](/character#attributes) damage lowers all
associated Skills to the new Attribute rank, until the
[Attribute](/character#attributes) damage is restored.

## Skill competitions

Characters compete against each others using skills. Unless otherwise stated,
the same skill is used for both parties.

## Available Skills

Below is a list of possible skills, provided by the Q* RPG system.

!!! info "Available [Skills](#skills)"
    Like any other RPG system, Q* provides the GM and player with a set of
    skills. Neither the system nor characters are limited to these skills: if
    you require different skills to suite your needs, then add them to your
    game. For balancing reasons try to restrict yourself to only 4 available
    skills per Attribute.
