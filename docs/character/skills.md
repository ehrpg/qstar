# Skills

> [Skills][] abstract your character's education, hobbies and fields of
> expertise.

Every character is defined by the following three categories of [Skills][].
While a character can have virtually *any* [Skill][], the categories list the
most common ones.

A Skill roll has to be equal to or higher than a **4** in order to succeed.
Skill rolls lower than a **4** fail. The GM can give your roll a bonus or
penalty based on circumstances.

A [Skill][] that is at a [d4](#d4) is considered **untrained**. Some [Skills][]
should only be usable if they are trained, indicated by a **"*"** next to their
name. These [Skills][] can still be used if untrained, but only for very basic
things.

## Skill Familiarization

Most [Skills][] are very vaguely described and not very specific to simplify
character creation and gameplay. Sometimes you might want to emphasize however,
that a [Skill][] is dramatically different than how the character would normale
use it. In this case, the [Skill][] roll should suffer a -2 penalty. For
exceptional knowledge about a certain topic, the GM may provide a +2 bonus to
the roll.

## Skill Categories

There are three different categories that you can improve by improving their
associated [Skills][].

Every 4 Character Points used in a single category improves the category's die
by one step. Each Category starts with a [d4][]. Category dies are used for very
basic tasks where no other [Skill][] applies, but mainly for combat related
checks.

!!! example "Skill categories and Skills"
    A character has two [Action][] Skills at a [d12][]. The cost of
    improving those [Skills][] to a [d12][] totals 8 Character Points. The
    character's [Action][] die is therefore a [d8][].

### Action

This category contains all [Skills][] that rely on might, speed, and have some
sort of physical interaction like running, swimming, climbing, shooting,
swinging a sword, etc.

It's also used for [Bulk][], [Pace][], [Turn Order](/crisis/#turn-order),
[Natural Healing](/crisis/#natural-healing) and resisting bodily effects.
