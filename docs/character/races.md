# Races

Every creature has a race, or at least a type that groups similar creatures into
the same category, e.g. animals or robots.

A race modifies:

* abilities, currencies, pools and skills
* adds perks and flaws,
* enables access to inherent stunts,
* and may add roleplaying Circumstances

A race also provides a creature with [Downtime](/character/#downtime-dt) for
character creation.

!!! tip "Race subtypes"
    Some races have further subtypes, that change the *base* race. E.g. in a
    cyberpunk setting there could be a bio-engineered slave race that resemble
    humans. Such a race could provide additional [Might](/character#might-mi), but
    decrease [Charisma](/character#charisma-ch) and add a roleplaying Circumstance
    in that they are shunned by the public.

    Subtypes share all other characteristics of the base race.

## Available races

Below is a list of possible races, provided by the Q* RPG system.

!!! tip "Available [Races](#races)"
    Like any other RPG system, Q* provides the GM and player with a set of
    races. Neither the system nor characters are limited to these races: if you
    require different races to suite your needs, then add them to your game.
