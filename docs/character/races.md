# Races

Every creature has a race, or at least a type that groups similar creatures into
the same category, e.g. animals or robots.

A race modifies:

* abilities, currencies, pools and skills
* adds perks and flaws,
* enables access to inherent stunts,
* and may add roleplaying Circumstances

A race also provides a creature with [Downtime](/character/#downtime) for
character creation.

## Available races

Below is a list of possible races, provided by the Q* RPG system.

    Like any other RPG system, Q* provides the GM and player with a set of
    races. Neither the system nor characters are limited to these races: if you
    require different races to suite your needs, then add them to your game.
