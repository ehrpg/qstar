# Races

> Every creature has a [Race][], or at least a type that groups similar
> creatures into the same category, e.g. animals or robots.

A [Race][] can modify almost all aspects of a creature, including: Skills,
Acquisitions, Health, Stats, roleplaying circumstances, etc.

!!! tip "Race subtypes"
    Some [Races][] have further subtypes, that change the *base* [Race][].
    Subtypes share all other characteristics of the base [Race][], unless
    otherwise noted.

## Available Races

Below is a list of possible [Races][], provided by the Q* RPG system.

!!! tip "Available Races"
    Like any other RPG system, Q* provides the GM and players with a set of
    [Races][]. Neither the system nor characters are limited to these [Races][]:
    if you require different [Races][] to suite your needs, then add them to
    your game.
