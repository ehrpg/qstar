# Character Creation

## Step-by-Step

> This section outlines the steps necessary to create a character from scratch.

### 1. Determine your character's concept

At every character's core lies the concept. What should your character be? A
thief, a wizard, or even a barbarian? Being familiar with the archetype of your
character, it's time to choose a race that suits your character idea best.

### 2. Choose a race

For a lot of settings and thus characters human is the most common choice. The
Setting you are playing may feature additional races, such as aliens, elves,
dwarves, or just subtypes of the human race such as martian colonists.

A character's Race has the biggest impact on role-playing, but it also
influences [Skills][], [Talents][] and other aspects of your character:

See [Races](/character/races) for a list of available races, or talk to your GM
if the race you want to play is not on there.

### 3. Assign Skills

A character has 16 Character Points (CP) that can be distributed among the available
[Skills][]. Each [Skill][] improvement costs 1 CP.

A [Skill][] category also has a die, which also starts at a [d4][]. Every 4 CP
in a single [Skill][] category increases that die by one step.

You cannot raise any Skill above a [d12](#d12).

### 4. Learn Talents

A character can unlock 2 [Talents][] upon character creation.

### 5. Buy Equipment

Every character needs some equipment. With your starting money, buy some
commonly helpful [items](/equipment/util-misc/), such as a torchlight, rations,
backpacks, etc. With the rest of your money you should buy a half decent
[Weapon](/equipment/weapons/) and some [Armour](/equipment/armour-outfits/).

### 6. Fill In The Blanks

Calculate all your character's stats. Remember, the almost any stat can be
influenced positively or negatively by circumstance like [Talents][].

Finally, give your character a name!
