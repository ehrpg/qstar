# Character Creation

## Step-by-Step

> This section outlines the steps necessary to create a character from scratch.

### 1. Start with the name

Think about who your character is. Where does he come from, why is he seeking
adventures, does he have enemies, is he looking for someone, etc. This should
narrow down the character's concept alot. It also helps to pick a Race,
[Skills][], etc. for your character.

### 2. Improve Skills

A character has 300 Character Points (CP) that can be distributed among the
available [Skills][]. See [Improving a
Skill](/character/skills#improving-a-skill).

A single [Skill][] cannot be raised over `50%` in this step.

### 3. Choose a race

For a lot of Settings and characters human is the most common choice. The
Setting you are playing may feature additional [Races], such as aliens, elves,
dwarves, or just subtypes of the human [Race][] such as martian colonists.

A character's [Race][] has the biggest impact on role-playing, but it also
influences [Skills][], [Perks][] and other aspects of your character:

See [Races][] for a list of available [Races], or talk to your GM if the
[Race][] you want to play is not on there.

### 4. Choose traits

You can choose up to 2 [Traits][]. [Traits][] can only be picked at character
creation, and not at a later time. [Traits][] are, besides the [Race][], the
only source that can modify the inherent value of a [Skill][]---unlike modifiers
which only give a bonus on a specific roll.

If you have an idea for a [Trait][] that would complement your character, talk
to your GM if he approves of it.

See [Traits][].

### 5. Pick Perks & Flaws

You can pick [Perks][] & [Flaws][] that further improve your character by making
[Skills][] better, or certain Actions available.

See [Perks][], and [Flaws][].

### 6. Buy Equipment

Every character needs some equipment. With your starting money, buy some
commonly helpful [items](/equipment/util-misc/), such as a torchlight, rations,
backpacks, etc. With the rest of your money you should buy a half decent
[Weapon](/equipment/weapons/) and some [Armour](/equipment/armour-outfits/).

### 7. Fill In The Blanks

Calculate all your character's stats. Remember, that almost any stat can be
influenced positively or negatively by modifiers.
