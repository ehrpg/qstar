# Character Creation

## Step-by-Step

> This section outlines the steps necessary to create a character from scratch.

### 1. Determine your character's concept

At every character's core lies the concept. What should your character be? A
daring thief? A spell-slinging wizard? Or a brute barbarian? Being familiar with
the archetype of your character, it's time to choose a race that suits you *or*
the character best.

### 2. Choose a race

For a lot of characters human is the most common choice. The Setting you are
playing may feature additional races, such as aliens, elves, dwarves, or just
subtypes of the human race such as earthers, martians, and belters.

A race is the cornerstone of every character - it's the foundation of your
character. Not only does it influence Attributes and Skills, but also Talents,
and most importantly roleplaying circumstances. For example elves might be
hostile towards dwarves, and vice versa.

See [Races](/character/races) for a list of available races, or talk to your GM
if the race you want to play is not on there.

### 3. Finalize Attributes

A new character gains 5 Attribute Points that have to be distributed among the 4
different Attributes: [Might](/character#might-mi),
[Speed](/character#speed-sp), [Intelligence](/character#intelligence-in), and
[Charisma](/character#charisma-ch). Raising an Attribute, e.g. from a [d4](#d4)
to a [d6](#d6), costs 1 point.

You cannot raise an Attribute above a [d12](#d12).

### 4. Assign Skills

A new character gains 12 Skill Points that can be distributed among the
available Skills. Each Skill improvement costs 1 point, as long as the Skill is
equal to or less than the corresponding Attribute. If the Skill exceeds the
Attribute, improving it costs 2 points.

Some Skills can only be used if they are trained. This means, that they require
1 Skill point to unlock the skill.

You cannot raise a Skill above a [d12](#d12).

### 5. Buy Equipment



### 6. Fill In The Blanks

Calculate the values for:

* Pace,
* Perception,
* [Parry](/character#parry),
* Toughness, and
* Health.

Finally, give you character a name!
