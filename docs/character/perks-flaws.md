# Perks & Flaws

Perks and flaws further customize your character and make them stand out more.

Perks and flaws that change values like maximum currencies use adjectives.

Perks that add abilities or improve abilities use nouns.

## Requirements

Perks and flaws are usually restricted by Ability ranks, Skill ranks, or other
stats. Races or GM decisions providing perks or flaws ignore the requirement.

If a perk states a Ability rank or Skill rank requirement, the character has to
have at least that rank. If the Ability rank or Skill rank drops below the
requirement, the character loses the benefit of the perk.

If a flaw states an Ability rank or Skill rank requirement, the character may not
exceed that rank. Also a flaw's requirement prohibits a character to improve the
Ability or Skill above the requirement.

## Perks

Perks unlock abilities, improve stats or change roleplayining circumstances in a
positive way.

While perks state their requirements and costs, your GM can require additional
things before you can *buy* a perk, i.e. you first have to:

* find someone who can train you,
* make acquiantances with important NPCs,
* use skills related to the perk,
* etc.

Also, if the perk is not reasonable at all for your character, the perk simply
isn't available to you.

## Flaws

Flaws outline behavior, add quirks or weaknesses to your character or change
roleplaying circumstances in a negative way.

<!-- TODO add flaw additional requirements text -->

Also, if the flaw is not reasonable at all for your character, the flaw simply
isn't available to you.

Some flaws can be removed, but that usually requires a lot of hard work. A GM
may even build an adventure around the flaw removal.
