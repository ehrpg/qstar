# Perks

Perks unlock Actions, improve stats or change roleplayining circumstances in a
positive way.

Any perk can only be picked once and costs at least 1 [INF][], unless otherwise
specified.

Perks are represented in the following way:

<div class="qs-list-test full-width p" markdown="1">

**Example Perk**{.hf} Description or benefit of the perk.

Requires
:   Requirements that have to be met in order for the perk to be available or
providing its benefits.

AP
:   If the perk unlocks a new Ability, the AP cost for this Ability is stated
here.

Multiple
:   If the perk can be picked multiple times, this value indicates how often it
can be picked.

!!! info "Available perks"
    Like any other RPG system, Q* provides the GM and player with a set of
    perks. Neither the system nor characters are limited to these perks: if
    you require different perks to suite your needs, then add them to your
    game.

!!! tip "[GM Tip] Acquiring perks"
    While perks state their requirements and costs, you as a GM can require
    additional things before a character can obtain a perk, i.e.:

    * find someone who can train you,
    * make acquiantances with important NPCs,
    * use [Skills][] related to the perk,
    * etc.

    Also, if the perk is not reasonable for a character at all, the perk simply
    isn't available.

## Requirements

Perks are usually restricted by category scores, [Skill][] values, or other
stats. [Races][] or GM decisions providing perks ignore the requirement.

If a perk states an [Attribute][] or [Skill][] requirement, the value has to be
met. If the [Attribute][] or [Skill][] drops below the requirement, the
character loses the benefit of the perk---but not the perk itself, in case the
requirements are met once again.
