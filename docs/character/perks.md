# Perks

Perks unlock Actions, improve stats or change roleplayining circumstances in a
positive way.

While perks state their requirements and costs, your GM can require additional
things before you can obtain a perk, i.e. you first have to:

* find someone who can train you,
* make acquiantances with important NPCs,
* use [Skills][] related to the perk,
* etc.

Also, if the perk is not reasonable for your character at all, the perk simply
isn't available to you.

Perks are represented in the following way:

<div class="qs-list-test full-width p" markdown="1">

**Example Perk**{.hf} Description or benefit of the perk.

Requires
:   Requirements that have to be met in order for the perk to be available or
providing its benefits.

AP
:   If the perk unlocks a new Ability, the AP cost for this Ability is stated
here.

!!! info "Available perks"
    Like any other RPG system, Q* provides the GM and player with a set of
    perks. Neither the system nor characters are limited to these perks: if
    you require different perks to suite your needs, then add them to your
    game.

## Requirements

Perks are usually restricted by category scores, [Skill][] values, or other
stats. [Races][] or GM decisions providing perks ignore the requirement.

If a perk states a category score or [Skill][] value requirement, the
requirement has to be met. If the category score or [Skill][] value drops below
the requirement, the character loses the benefit of the perk---but not the perk
itself, in case the requirements are met once again.

Every perk also costs 1 [ST][].
