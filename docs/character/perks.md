# Perks

Perks unlock Attributes, improve stats or change roleplayining circumstances in a
positive way.

While perks state their requirements and costs, your GM can require additional
things before you can *buy* a perk, i.e. you first have to:

* find someone who can train you,
* make acquiantances with important NPCs,
* use skills related to the perk,
* etc.

Also, if the perk is not reasonable at all for your character, the perk simply
isn't available to you.

## Requirements

Perks are usually restricted by Attribute ranks, Skill ranks, or other stats.
Races or GM decisions providing perks ignore the requirement.

If a perk states a Attribute rank or Skill rank requirement, the character has to
have at least that rank. If the Attribute rank or Skill rank drops below the
requirement, the character loses the benefit of the perk.

## Character Perks

Below is a list of possible perks, provided by the Q* RPG system.

!!! info "Available perks"
    Like any other  RPG system, Q* provides the GM and player with a set of
    perks. Neither the system nor characters are limited to these perks: if
    you require different perks to suite your needs, then add them to your
    game.

Perks are represented in the following way:
