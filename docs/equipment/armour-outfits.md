## Armour

Armour increases your character's [Toughness](/character#toughness), and
prevents damage a character may receive. Armour has Durability for these types:

* Normal (physical) Damage,
* **Fire**{:.qstar-flame} Damage,
* **Cold**{:.qstar-thermometer-cold} Damage,
* **Acid**, **Radiation** or **Biohazard**{:.qstar-biohazard} Damage.

One wound reduces the Armour's Durability of the wound's corresponding type by
one. When the Durability of a type reaches 0, it does not provide any damage
reduction against this type anymore.
