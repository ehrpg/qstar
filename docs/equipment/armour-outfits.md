## Armour

Armour prevents damage a character may receive. Armour provides Damage Reduction
(DR) for these damage types:

* [Physical][] (including Kinetic) Damage,
* [Fire][] (including Explosive) Damage,
* [Cold][] Damage,
* [Acid][] (including Radiation, Biohazard) Damage.

Any incoming damage is reduced by the armour's DR value for the type of the
damage first.
