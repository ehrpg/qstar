# Armour & Outfits

### Armour

> Armour is the first layer of defenses and prevents some damage a character
> receives.

Armour provides Damage Reduction (DR) for these damage types:

- [Physical][] (including Kinetic) Damage,
- [Fire][] (including Explosive) Damage,
- [Cold][] Damage,
- [Acid][] (including Radiation, Biohazard) Damage.

Any damage you receive is reduced by the armour's DR value for the type of the
damage. The damage blocked by the DR is substracted from the armour's
Durability.

Any incoming damage is reduced by the armour's DR value for the type of the
damage first.

| Hazmat Suit  |     45     |      0       |    4     |    8     |    10    |  4   |  2.500 |    2    |



#### Repairing Armour

Armour that reaches 0 Durability does not provide DR anymore. It has to be
repaired first, which costs half its **Cost**.

### Outfits

Outfits are worn on a character's body, but do not provide DR. They provide
other bonus, such as additional **MAG** capacity, bonuses on [Stealth][] rolls,
etc.
