# Equipment Traits

Equipment Traits make an item more unique. Some Traits can be added to a weapon
via attachments and upgrades.

Every Trait costs [RES][]. The [RES][] cost is *added* to the weapons [RES][]
cost. If a character does not have enough [RES][] for both the weapon and the
Trait, the Trait is lost first.
