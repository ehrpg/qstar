# Equipment

<!-- Economy: Use real-life value of items, multiply by 10 and round to nearest sensible integer. -->

All entries list the price for a single item. If items are sold in bulk, the `#`
column shows the amount sold for the provided price.

Some items require additional Acquisitions to be unlocked, maintained or bought.

!!! tip "Assets"
    Some items count as Assets, which can be used to provide a bonus on a
    **Task** roll for related checks. Usually an item states if it's an Asset,
    but creative use can always turn other items into Assets as well!

## Credits

> [Credits][] are a universal currency for buying most things.

All items cost [Credits][], while some items may cost [Resource][] instead or in
addition. This [Resource][] cost abstracts the maintenance of an item, e.g.
ammunition, cleaning, restocking etc.

Whenever there is a cost listed without units, then Credits are used.

## Bulk

*Only items that are not equipped, e.g. rations, a tent, etc. are subject to
this rule.*

An item that specifies it's [Bulk][] takes up that much Inventory Space. Ten
light items specified by a [Bulk][] value of **L** count as 1 [Bulk][]. Some
items' [Bulk][] are negligible; they do not list their [Bulk][] value.

Each character's Carrying Capacity is 10 modifed by any circumstance. A
character can carry this much [Bulk][] without penalty; if he carries more he
gains the [Slowed](/crisis/#slowed) condition. A character can't hold or carry
more [Bulk][] than twice his Carrying Capacity.

!!! summary "Carrying Capacity"
    <div class="formula formula-top formula-bottom">
      <span>Carrying Capacity</span> =
      <span data-bracket-bottom="Base">10</span> Â±
      <span data-bracket-top="Environment / Traits / Race">Circumstance</span>
    </div>

!!! summary "Maximum Bulk"
    <div class="formula formula-top formula-bottom">
      <span>Maximum Bulk</span> =
      <span>Carrying Capacity * 2</span>
    </div>

## Looting

### Ammunition

If you find ammunition, the GM can specify how many clips you can regain from a
single unit of [LOOT][].

### Equipment

If a looted item requires [Resources][] a character may keep it. At the end of
the session the character can spend his available [Resources][] on it to keep
it.

If the character doesn't want to keep it or doesn't have enough [Resources][] to
pay for the item at the end of the current session, the item is lost.

## Equipment traits

An item *can* have additional traits, making them more unique.
