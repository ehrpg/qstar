# Weapons

All melee weapons use the [Melee skill](/character/skills#melee), while ranged
weapons use the [Light weapon skill](/character/skills#light-weapons), unless
otherwise noted.

!!! tip "Weapon Asset"
    Every Weapon can count as an Asset when trying to intimidate somebody with
    the [Intimidate Skill](/character/skills/#intimidate).

## Weapon Stats

<div class="qs-list-test full-width" markdown="1">

##### HIT

indicates the bonus or penalty the Attack Skill roll receives.

##### DMG

indicates the bonus for the damage roll.

##### RNG

indicates the weapon's range increment. Each increment imposes a cumulative -1
penalty to the attack. `RNG * 10` is the maximum effective range of the weapon.
Any target within the the weapon's range increment does not impose a penalty.

##### RoF

indicates the weapon's rate of fire. A rate of fire higher than 1 allows you to
roll one additional time at the expense of 1 [AP][] for each point higher than
1, unless otherwise noted by the weapon. Using a higher **RoF** also uses up
more **CAP**.

##### MAG

provides the number of magazines. A long rest refills the amount of magazines
you have.

##### CAP

indicates the amount of uses per magazine. The weapon has to be **reloaded** if
the current capacity reaches to zero.

##### REL

indicates how much [AP][] it takes to reload the weapon.
</div>

!!! tip "[GM Tip] - Realistic Magazines"
    When a weapon is reloaded any remaining bullets in the current magazine are
    lost, unless the magazine is purposely kept and its bullet retrieved. This
    should only be doable outside of combat, or when in combat and outside of
    immediate danger.

!!! tip "[GM Tip] - MAG refilling"
    If your setting requires it, you can overrule the MAG refilling rule. Buying
    one MAG should cost 1/25 of the weapon's CR cost.
