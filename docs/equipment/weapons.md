# Weapons

All melee weapons use the [Melee skill](/character/skills#melee), while ranged
weapons use the [Light weapon skill](/character/skills#light-weapons), unless
otherwise noted.

!!! tip "Weapon Asset"
    Every Weapon can count as an Asset when trying to intimidate somebody with
    the [Intimidate Skill](/character/skills/#intimidate).

## Weapon Stats

<div class="qs-list-test full-width" markdown="1">

##### HIT

indicates the bonus or penalty the Attack Skill roll receives.

##### DMG

indicates the bonus for the damage roll.

##### RNG

indicates the weapon's range increment. Each increment imposes a -1 penalty to
the attack.

##### RoF

indicates the weapon's rate of fire. A rate of fire higher than 1 allows you to
roll one additional time for each point higher than 1. Using a higher **RoF**
also uses up more **CAP**.

##### MAG

provides the number of magazines. A long rest refills the amount of magazines
you have.

##### CAP

indicates the amount of uses per magazine. The weapon has to be **reloaded** if
the current capacity drops to zero.

##### REL

indicates how much [AP][] it takes to reload the weapon.

!!! tip "[GM Tip] - MAG refilling"
    If your setting requires it, you can overrule the MAG refilling rule. Buying
    one MAG should cost 1/25 of the weapon's CR cost.
