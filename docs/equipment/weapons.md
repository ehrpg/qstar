# Weapons

All melee weapons use the [Melee](/character/skills#melee) skill, while ranged
weapons use the [Light weapon](/character/skills#light-weapons) skill, unless
otherwise noted.

* **HIT** indicates the bonus or penalty the Attack Skill roll receives.

* **DMG** indicates the dice for the damage roll.

* **RNG** indicates the weapon's range increment. Each increment imposes a -1
  penalty to the attack.

* **RoF** indicates the weapon's rate of fire. A rate of fire higher than 1
  allows you to add another [1d6](#d6) for each point higher than 1. Using a
  higher **RoF** also uses up more **CAP**.

* **MAG** provides the number of magazines. A long rest refills the amount of
  magazines you have.

* **CAP** indicates the amount of uses per magazine. The weapon has to be
  **reloaded** if the current capacity drops to zero.

* **REL** indicates how much AP it takes to reload the weapon.

!!! tip "Weapon Asset"
    Every Weapon can count as an Asset when trying to intimidate somebody with
    the Oratory Skill.

!!! tip "[GM Tip] MAG refilling"
    If your setting requires it, you can overrule the MAG refilling rule. Buying
    one MAG should cost 1/25 of the weapon's CR cost.
