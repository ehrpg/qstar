# Weapons

All melee weapons use the [Melee](/character/skills#melee) skill, while ranged
weapons use the [Light weapon](/character/skills#light-weapons) skill, unless
otherwise noted.

* **HIT** indicates the bonus or penalty the Attack Skill roll receives.

* **DMG** indicates the dice for the damage roll.

* **RNG** indicates the weapon's range increment. Each increment imposes a -1
  penalty to the attack.

* **RoF** indicates the weapon's rate of fire. A rate of fire higher than 1
  allows you to add another [1d6](#d6) for each point higher than 1. Using a
  higher **RoF** also uses up more **CAP**.

* **MAG** provides the number of magazines. A long rest refills the amount of
  magazines you have.

* **CAP** indicates the amount of uses per magazine. The weapon has to be
  **reloaded** if the current capacity drops to zero.

* **REL** indicates how much AP it takes to reload the weapon.

!!! tip "Weapon Asset"
    Every Weapon can count as an Asset when trying to intimidate somebody with
    the Oratory Skill.
