# Weapons

All melee weapons use the [Melee skill](/character/skills#melee), while ranged
weapons use the [Light weapon skill](/character/skills#light-weapons), unless
otherwise noted.

!!! tip "Weapon Asset"
    Every Weapon can count as an Asset when trying to intimidate somebody with
    the [Intimidate Skill](/character/skills/#intimidate).

!!! tip "[GM Tip] Weapon Stats"
    Weapons are usually classified into light, medium and heavy weapons. They
    should deal between 1 and 6 **DMG** respectively. Also, only the best
    weapons should have a **HIT** of +4.

## Weapon Stats

<div class="qs-list-test full-width" markdown="1">

##### HIT

indicates the bonus or penalty the Attack Skill roll receives.

##### DMG

indicates the bonus for the damage.

##### AoE

indicates how big the radius is in tiles around the center of the Area of
Effect. Creatures within the radius are effected by the AoE, while creatures
outside are uneffected.

##### RNG

indicates the weapon's range increment. Each increment imposes a cumulative -1
penalty to the attack. `RNG * 10` is the maximum effective range of the weapon.
Any target within the weapon's first range increment does not impose a penalty.

##### RoF

indicates the weapon's rate of fire. An RoF higher than 1 allows you to make
optional, consecutive Attack rolls for the same or even different targets at the
expense of 1 [AP][] per extra Attack, unless otherwise noted by the weapon.
Using a higher **RoF** also uses up more **CAP**.

##### MAG

provides the number of magazines. A long rest refills the amount of magazines
you have. **MAG** can also be refilled with [LOOT][].

##### CAP

indicates the amount of uses per magazine. The weapon has to be **reloaded** if
the current capacity reaches to zero.

##### REL

indicates how much [AP][] it takes to reload the weapon.
</div>

!!! tip "[GM Tip] - Realistic Magazines"
    When a weapon is reloaded any remaining bullets in the current magazine are
    lost, unless the magazine is purposely kept and its bullet retrieved. This
    should only be doable outside of combat, or when in combat and outside of
    immediate danger.

!!! tip "[GM Tip] - MAG refilling"
    If your setting requires it, you can overrule the MAG refilling rule. Buying
    one MAG should cost 1/25 of the weapon's CR cost.

## Weapon Tags

A weapon can have one or more of the following tags.

<div class="qs-list-test full-width" markdown="1">

##### Bolt-action

After each Attack you have to repeat the weapon for 1 [AP][]. **REL** indicates
the [AP][] cost to reload a single bullet.

##### Pump-action

See [Bolt-action](#bolt-action).

##### Close range

Close range weapons deal double their weapon damage when Attacking targets
within the first range increment.

##### Long range

+1 on **HIT** for the Attack when using an **RoF** of 1.

##### Explosive

An explosive weapon deals more damage, the closer the target is to the center of
the **AoE**. At the center, an explosive weapon deals its damage multiplied by
its **AoE** value. Per tile away from the center, the weapon deals 1x its damage
less, to a minimum of its normal damage.
<br>
For example, a Grenade (**DMG**: 3; **AoE**: 3) deals 9 damage at the center, 6
damage next to the center, and 3 damage when the target is away 2 or 3 tiles.
