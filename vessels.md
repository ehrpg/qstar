# Vessels

## Type

All vessels are given one more types defining in which environments they
operate in. The environment can impose penalties to a vessel, or simply disable,
damage, or destroy it.

Space means that the vessel is capable of manoeuvring in outer
space, air means that is also capable of flying through an atmosphere. If a
vessel has both space and air listed, the vessel is capable of making a
transition from atmosphere to outer space and vice versa. Land means that the
vessel moves on land, and water means that it moves on or in water.

## Vessel Statistics

### Attack

Any vessel is outfitted with electronics for aim assistance, maneuvering and so
forth. Bigger and better vessels have better and more sophisticated electronics
than smaller and cheaper vessels. The attack value is a bonus the pilot of a
small vessel or officer of a bigger vessel gains when attacking.

### Defense

Ships also have an armour rating. Armour reduces the incoming damage (both
normal and critical) by the listed damage reduction amount. Any damage above the
damage reduction is passed on to the ships shield hitpoints or hull integrity.
The full damage is subtracted from the hit points of the armour. If the armour
reaches zero hit points its damage reduction drops to zero and thus stops being
useful. 

A vessel can outfit multiple armour platings. The damage reduction is not
cummulative, but the armour hitpoints are, given the armour is of the same type.
Damage is always substracted from the armour providing the most damage reduction
first.

### Speed

Smaller vessels have the upper hand when it comes to maneuvering. As such, they
gain a bonus to evading enemy fire, while bigger, slower vessels are penalised.

### Shield Hitpoints

Shiels come in great variety to protect a vessel versus any kind of damage. F.e.
a shield might be a simple sand screen that deflects beam and laser weapons.
Also, point-defense versus small fighter wings, or missiles add to the shield
hitpoints value. The hitpoints abstract the recharge speed of shields, or reload
speed of point defense.

### Hull Integrity

Hull Integrity is the Health for vessels, and depends on the size and quality of
the vessel. If the hull integrity drops below one half of the maximum, the
vessel is venting atmosphere, which itself might be deadly in a space combat
scenario. If the hull integrity reaches zero, it is utterly destroyed in a
blast. Certain weapons are designed to drop the hull integrity temporarily, so
that the vessel can be boarded rather than destroyed. See vessel equipment for
details.

### Size

Every vessel is categorised into small, medium, large, or capital vessels. The
vessel statistics also provide a single value for its size. The size defines how
much space there is on a vessel for cargo, rooms such as quarters, or even
specialised modules like docking bays.
